Financial institutions recognized the potential of digital technology to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. As a result, online banking emerged, allowing customers to access their accounts, transfer funds, and perform transactions from the comfort of their homes.</p><h2 id=the-rise-of-online-banking>The Rise of Online Banking</h2><p>The proliferation of smartphones and internet access has further accelerated the growth of online banking.
