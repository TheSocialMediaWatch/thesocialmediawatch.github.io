These include statistical methods, machine learning algorithms, and data mining techniques. Let&rsquo;s break down some of the most commonly used approaches in predictive analytics.</p><h3 id=1-regression-analysis>1. <strong>Regression Analysis</strong></h3><p>Regression analysis is one of the most fundamental statistical techniques used in predictive analytics. It focuses on identifying relationships between variables and predicting the value of one variable based on the value of another. Linear regression is one of the most widely used forms, where the goal is to establish a linear relationship between the predictor (independent variable) and the predicted outcome (dependent variable).</p><p>For example, in real estate, regression analysis can be used to predict property prices based on factors like location, square footage, and other features.</p><h3 id=2-classification>2. <strong>Classification</strong></h3><p>Classification is a machine learning technique that involves categorizing data into predefined classes or labels. Predictive models built using classification algorithms can be used to predict outcomes such as whether a customer will churn, whether an email is spam, or whether a loan applicant is likely to default.</p><p>Common classification algorithms include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. These models analyze historical data to classify new data points into the appropriate categories.</p><h3 id=3-time-series-analysis>3. <strong>Time Series Analysis</strong></h3><p>Time series analysis is used to predict future values based on historical data.
