Despite these challenges, many made significant strides in expanding knowledge about the universe.</p><h3 id=annie-jump-cannon-18631941>Annie Jump Cannon (1863–1941)</h3><p>Annie Jump Cannon was an American astronomer whose work revolutionized the classification of stars. She developed the stellar classification system, known as the Harvard Classification Scheme, which is still used to categorize stars by their spectral type. Her meticulous work in cataloging stars led to the identification and organization of over 225,000 stars.</p><p>Cannon’s work is a testament to her perseverance and intellectual brilliance. Despite facing discrimination and being largely overlooked during her career, she made discoveries that fundamentally shaped the field of astronomy. Her contributions have paved the way for modern astrophysics and stellar astronomy.</p><h3 id=henrietta-swan-leavitt-18681921>Henrietta Swan Leavitt (1868–1921)</h3><p>Henrietta Swan Leavitt’s work in the early 20th century was integral to our understanding of the size and scale of the universe. She discovered a crucial relationship between the luminosity of certain types of variable stars, known as Cepheid variables, and their period of pulsation. This discovery provided astronomers with a reliable method of measuring the distances to faraway galaxies, revolutionizing the study of cosmology.</p><p>Leavitt’s discovery of the period-luminosity relation opened the door to our current understanding of the vastness of space and led to the establishment of the universe&rsquo;s expansion. Despite being largely unrecognized during her lifetime, her work has had an enduring impact on astronomy.</p><h3 id=vera-rubin-19282016>Vera Rubin (1928–2016)</h3><p>Vera Rubin was an American astronomer whose work provided key evidence for the existence of dark matter. In the 1970s, Rubin observed the rotation curves of galaxies, which showed that stars on the outer edges of galaxies moved faster than could be explained by visible matter alone. This led her to hypothesize the existence of an invisible substance, now known as dark matter, which accounts for the majority of the universe’s mass.</p><p>Rubin’s work was groundbreaking in the field of astrophysics and cosmology, and her contributions have become foundational in our understanding of the universe’s structure. Despite the challenges she faced as a woman in a male-dominated field, her legacy has inspired future generations of scientists.</p><h2 id=women-in-contemporary-astronomy>Women in Contemporary Astronomy</h2><p>Today, women are playing an increasingly important role in shaping the future of astronomy.
