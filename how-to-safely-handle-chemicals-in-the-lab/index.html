Always check glove compatibility with the chemicals you&rsquo;re using.</p></li><li><p><strong>Goggles or Face Shields</strong>: Always wear chemical splash goggles or face shields when handling hazardous chemicals. Regular eyeglasses are not adequate protection against chemical splashes. In addition, face shields offer broader coverage, protecting the face and neck from splashes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Respirators</strong>: For chemicals that produce hazardous vapors or fumes, use appropriate respirators to protect your respiratory system. Choose respirators based on the chemical’s volatility and the exposure risk.</p></li><li><p><strong>Footwear</strong>: Wear closed-toe shoes and sturdy footwear to protect your feet from spills and accidents.</p></li></ul><h3 id=22-ensuring-proper-fit>2.2 Ensuring Proper Fit</h3><p>It’s important to ensure that all your PPE fits properly. Loose gloves, ill-fitting lab coats, or goggles that don’t seal properly can leave you exposed to dangerous chemicals. Check that everything fits snugly and comfortably before beginning any experiment.</p><h2 id=3-proper-chemical-handling-techniques>3. Proper Chemical Handling Techniques</h2><p>The way chemicals are handled directly impacts safety. Always follow the recommended procedures for using, transferring, and disposing of chemicals to minimize risks.</p><h3 id=31-handling-chemicals>3.1 Handling Chemicals</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Labeling</strong>: Properly label all chemicals, even if you’re transferring them to a smaller container. Ensure that all labels are clear, legible, and include critical information such as the chemical name, concentration, hazard warnings, and expiration date (if applicable).</p></li><li><p><strong>Minimize Exposure</strong>: Always handle chemicals in a well-ventilated area, such as under a fume hood. Avoid direct inhalation of fumes, vapors, or dust, and be cautious of chemical reactions that may release harmful gases.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid Eating or Drinking</strong>: Never eat, drink, or chew gum in the laboratory. Chemicals can contaminate food and beverages, leading to ingestion or absorption through the mouth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Correct Tools</strong>: Use the proper glassware, containers, and equipment designed for the chemicals you&rsquo;re working with. Some materials, such as plastic, may degrade or react with certain chemicals, while others may be prone to breaking under pressure or heat.</p></li><li><p><strong>Careful Mixing</strong>: When mixing chemicals, always follow the recommended procedures. Never mix chemicals unless you are certain it is safe to do so. Always add acid to water (not the reverse) to prevent dangerous splashes or reactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Handle Flammable Chemicals Safely</strong>: Store flammable chemicals in approved containers and keep them away from heat sources, open flames, and sparks. Use spark-proof electrical equipment when working with volatile substances.</p></li></ul><h3 id=32-chemical-storage>3.2 Chemical Storage</h3><p>Proper storage of chemicals is essential for preventing accidents.
