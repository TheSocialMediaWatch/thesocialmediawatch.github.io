It's a number that lenders, creditors, and even some employers use to assess your creditworthiness. Unfortunately, many people are unaware of the importance of maintaining a good credit score, until they're rejected for a loan or credit card. In this post, we'll delve into the world of credit scores, exploring what they are, how they're calculated, and most importantly, how to improve yours.
What is a Credit Score?
A credit score is a numerical representation of your credit history, reflecting how well you manage your debts and credit accounts. It's calculated by credit reporting agencies such as Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, using data from your credit accounts, credit inquiries, payment history, and other financial information. The resulting score falls between 300 and 850, with higher scores indicating better credit habits.
How is a Credit Score Calculated?
The calculation of a credit score involves multiple factors, weighted according to their importance. Here's a breakdown of the major components:</p><p>Payment history (35%): On-time payments, late payments, and accounts sent to collections all impact your score.
Credit utilization (30%): The amount you owe relative to your credit limit affects your score.
Length of credit history (15%): A longer credit history with good payment behavior is beneficial.
Credit mix (10%): A diverse mix of different credit types (e.g., credit cards, loans, mortgages) can positively impact your score.
New credit (10%): Applying for too much credit in a short period can negatively affect your score.</p><p>Why is a Good Credit Score Important?

Avoid actions that lower your score: Closing old accounts, applying for too much credit, or making late payments can negatively impact your score.</p><p>Common Credit Score Myths Debunked
Here are some common myths surrounding credit scores that are worth debunking:</p><p>Myth: Closing old accounts hurts my credit score.
