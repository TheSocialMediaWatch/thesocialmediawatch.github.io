This victory forever changed the perception of California wine and solidified Napa Valley as a premier wine destination.</p><p>The valley is home to over 400 wineries, ranging from boutique, family-owned estates to larger, iconic producers. Visitors can enjoy wine tastings at stunning vineyard estates, tour cellars, and explore the picturesque towns of St. Helena, Yountville, and Calistoga.
