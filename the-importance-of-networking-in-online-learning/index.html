While online courses and degree programs have made it possible for people to access high-quality education from anywhere in the world, they also present unique challenges. One of the most significant hurdles facing online learners is the sense of isolation that can come from studying alone.
Without the social interactions and face-to-face connections that come with traditional campus-based learning, online students can sometimes feel disconnected from their peers and instructors. This is where networking comes in – an essential component of the online learning experience that can help learners build meaningful relationships, access valuable resources, and stay motivated throughout their studies.
The Importance of Human Connection
Studies have shown that students who have strong social connections to their peers and instructors are more likely to persist with their studies and achieve academic success. This is not surprising, given that social support is a well-known predictor of educational outcomes. However, online learning makes it more difficult to form these connections, as learners are often isolated from one another and may not have the opportunity to interact with their instructors in person.
Networking can help to bridge this gap by providing a platform for online learners to connect with one another, share experiences, and learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. By participating in online communities, joining study groups, or attending webinars and conferences, learners can build relationships with their peers and develop a sense of belonging to a community of learners.
