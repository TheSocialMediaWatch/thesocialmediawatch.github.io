A niche is a specialized area or subject matter that you understand well and can write about with authority. This niche can be anything from technology, health, and finance to lifestyle, travel, and education.</p><p>Why is having a niche important?</p><ul><li><strong>Focus:</strong> It helps you focus your efforts and become an expert in a particular field.</li><li><strong>Demand:</strong> Clients often look for writers who understand their industries.</li><li><strong>Higher Pay:</strong> Specialized knowledge can often command better rates.</li><li><strong>Marketing:</strong> Tailoring your portfolio and pitches to a niche attracts relevant clients.</li></ul><p>Spend time exploring what subjects excite you the most and where your background or interests align.
