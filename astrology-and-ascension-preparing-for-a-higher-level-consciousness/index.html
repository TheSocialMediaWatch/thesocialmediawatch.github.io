Unfortunately, many people discard the ancient wisdom, primarily astrology, that offers tremendous insights into the secrets of the universe. In this blog post, we will explore how astrology and ascension are inextricably linked, preparing us for a higher-level consciousness.</p><p>Astrology is the study of the movements and positioning of celestial bodies to understand their impact on human lives and societies. It is fascinating how ancient civilizations took note of the stars and planets, attributing their influence on human behavior, nature, and seemingly everything around them. Astrology sheds invaluable light on understanding our cosmic origins, refining our spiritual journeys, and sharpening our self-awareness.</p><p>Ascension, conversely, is a process that unfolds for those who dare to be aware of these cosmic energies. This transformative process involves the expansion and elevation of human consciousness to higher planes of existence. Ascension is integral to spiritual evolution, and astrology provides the compass for this enlightening journey.</p><p>Though many view astrology as pseudoscience, it is merely a bridge to revealing the truth about ourselves and the cosmos. This enlightenment settles deep within us because it resonates with the ineffable divine wisdom we obscure in our unconscious selves. When we unveil these mysteries hidden in the celestial tapestry, we find our spiritual purpose.</p><p>The 12 astrological signs, each ruled by zodiac signs, planets, and their corresponding elements, offer unique traits and divine guidance to individuals. These traits, complemented by planetary alignments in our birth charts, influence our personalities and spiritual inclinations. Let&rsquo;s examine each celestial sign and its impact on ascension.</p><ol><li><p>Aries (March 21 - April 19)
