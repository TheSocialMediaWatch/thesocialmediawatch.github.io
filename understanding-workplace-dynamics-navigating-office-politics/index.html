Office politics are the informal and often unspoken power structures and relationships that influence decision-making within an organization. Understanding that these dynamics exist allows you to approach your work environment with a more discerning eye. It&rsquo;s important to recognize that office politics are not inherently negative; they are simply a part of the social fabric of any workplace.</p><h2 id=build-authentic-relationships>Build Authentic Relationships</h2><p>Building authentic relationships with your colleagues is key to navigating office politics.
