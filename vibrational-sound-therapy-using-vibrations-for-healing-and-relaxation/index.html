However, when the natural vibrational frequencies are disrupted, it can lead to stress, illness, and discomfort.</p><p>Vibrational sound therapy aims to restore the body&rsquo;s natural balance by using specific frequencies and vibrations. This can be achieved through various instruments such as Tibetan singing bowls, tuning forks, gongs, and even the human voice.

Clients are encouraged to simply relax and allow the vibrations to work their magic.</p><p>Sessions can vary in length, ranging from a few minutes to an hour or more, depending on individual needs and preferences.
