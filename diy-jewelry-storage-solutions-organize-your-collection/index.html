A cluttered jewelry collection can become a frustrating mess, leading to tangled necklaces, misplaced rings, and lost earrings. Organizing your jewelry collection doesn&rsquo;t need to be difficult or costly. With a little creativity and some DIY effort, you can create functional and aesthetically pleasing storage solutions that will keep your jewelry organized and easy to access.</p><p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore a variety of DIY jewelry storage solutions to help you organize your collection, no matter how big or small. From simple storage boxes to repurposed furniture and wall-mounted racks, there’s a solution to fit every style and space.</p><h2 id=1-upcycled-drawer-organizer>1. <strong>Upcycled Drawer Organizer</strong></h2><p>One of the simplest ways to store jewelry is by using an old drawer or small box you already have. Rather than buying a commercial jewelry box, consider upcycling an old drawer into a custom jewelry organizer. This DIY solution works especially well if you want to keep your jewelry in separate compartments for easy access.</p><h3 id=materials-needed>Materials Needed:</h3><ul><li>Old drawer (could be from an old dresser or desk)</li><li>Dividers or small containers</li><li>Felt or fabric (optional for lining)</li><li>Glue gun (optional)</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-it>How to Make It:</h3><ol><li>Start by cleaning the drawer thoroughly. If the drawer is in good condition, you can leave it as-is, or you may want to paint it to give it a fresh look.</li><li>Next, divide the drawer into sections to organize your jewelry. You can use dividers made from cardboard, wood, or even small containers to separate your earrings, rings, bracelets, and necklaces.</li><li>For added protection, line the bottom of the compartments with felt or fabric. This soft lining will prevent your jewelry from scratching or tangling.</li><li>Organize your jewelry by type and color. Rings can go in one section, earrings in another, and necklaces in yet another. If you&rsquo;re short on space, you can also roll your chains and store them in a small container to prevent them from tangling.</li><li>If you&rsquo;d like, use a glue gun to secure the dividers in place.</li></ol><p>With this DIY jewelry organizer, you’ll have an easy-to-use, customized solution that will help keep your collection neatly stored and easy to find.</p><h2 id=2-wall-mounted-jewelry-display>2. <strong>Wall-Mounted Jewelry Display</strong></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re short on drawer space or prefer to have your jewelry displayed where you can see it, a wall-mounted jewelry display might be the perfect solution. By mounting hooks, shelves, or trays on your wall, you can keep your jewelry on display while also organizing it in a way that&rsquo;s both functional and decorative.</p><h3 id=materials-needed-1>Materials Needed:</h3><ul><li>Wooden board or shelf</li><li>Hooks or nails</li><li>Small containers or trays</li><li>Decorative items (optional)</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-it-1>How to Make It:</h3><ol><li>Choose a space on your wall where you&rsquo;d like to mount the jewelry display. A space above a vanity or near a mirror works well, as it provides easy access while getting ready.</li><li>Use a wooden board or shelf as the base for your display. You can paint or stain the wood to match your room’s decor, or leave it natural for a more rustic look.</li><li>Attach hooks to the board for hanging necklaces, bracelets, or watches. Make sure to space them out evenly so that each piece has enough room.</li><li>Install small containers or trays on the shelf to store rings, earrings, or other small items. You can use glass jars, small bowls, or decorative trays to add a personal touch to the display.</li><li>Optionally, you can add decorative elements like plants, candles, or small figurines to enhance the look of your jewelry display.</li></ol><p>By mounting your jewelry on the wall, you can not only organize your collection but also create a beautiful display that adds a touch of elegance to your room. This method also prevents necklaces from tangling and keeps everything easily accessible.</p><h2 id=3-repurposed-frame-jewelry-organizer>3. <strong>Repurposed Frame Jewelry Organizer</strong></h2><p>Another creative DIY solution is to repurpose an old picture frame into a jewelry organizer. This option allows you to display your jewelry while keeping it neatly organized. It works especially well for earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.</p><h3 id=materials-needed-2>Materials Needed:</h3><ul><li>Old picture frame (with or without glass)</li><li>Chicken wire or mesh</li><li>Staple gun or nails</li><li>Paint (optional)</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-it-2>How to Make It:</h3><ol><li>Start by selecting a picture frame you no longer use. It can be an old frame you have lying around the house, or you can find one at a thrift store.</li><li>If the frame has glass, remove it, as you&rsquo;ll be replacing it with chicken wire or mesh.</li><li>Cut a piece of chicken wire or mesh to fit the size of the frame. Use a staple gun or nails to secure the mesh inside the frame. The mesh will serve as a place to hang your jewelry.</li><li>Optionally, paint the frame to match your room’s color scheme.</li><li>Hang the frame on the wall and start organizing your jewelry! You can hang necklaces, bracelets, and even earrings on the mesh, keeping everything visible and easy to reach.</li></ol><p>This upcycled frame organizer is not only functional but also adds a unique, rustic charm to your space. It&rsquo;s a great way to recycle old materials and create something both practical and decorative.</p><h2 id=4-diy-jewelry-roll>4. <strong>DIY Jewelry Roll</strong></h2><p>For those who prefer a portable solution, a DIY jewelry roll is a fantastic option. This compact organizer can be easily stored in a drawer, suitcase, or on a shelf. It works especially well for travel, as it keeps your jewelry secure and tangle-free.</p><h3 id=materials-needed-3>Materials Needed:</h3><ul><li>Soft fabric (such as felt or cotton)</li><li>Ribbon or elastic bands</li><li>Needle and thread (or sewing machine)</li><li>Scissors</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-it-3>How to Make It:</h3><ol><li>Cut a piece of fabric large enough to hold your jewelry when rolled up. The fabric should be soft to protect your jewelry from scratches.</li><li>Fold the fabric in half, with the outside facing inward, and sew along the edges, leaving one side open.</li><li>Turn the fabric inside out so that the soft side is on the outside.</li><li>Create small pockets by sewing dividers into the fabric. These pockets will hold rings, earrings, and other small pieces of jewelry.</li><li>For necklaces and bracelets, sew a loop at the top of the roll where you can thread a ribbon or elastic band to keep everything in place.</li><li>When you’re ready to use it, roll up the fabric and tie it with the ribbon or band. This keeps your jewelry secure and organized while on the go.</li></ol><p>This simple yet effective solution is perfect for those who travel frequently or want a portable way to store their jewelry collection.</p><h2 id=5-repurposed-jewelry-tree>5. <strong>Repurposed Jewelry Tree</strong></h2><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to display and organize your jewelry in a way that doubles as décor, a DIY jewelry tree is a perfect choice. By using a branch or wire frame, you can create a stylish and functional jewelry holder.</p><h3 id=materials-needed-4>Materials Needed:</h3><ul><li>Branch (or wire coat hanger)</li><li>Vase or pot</li><li>Rocks or gravel</li><li>Glue gun or wire</li><li>Paint (optional)</li></ul><h3 id=how-to-make-it-4>How to Make It:</h3><ol><li>Start by selecting a branch that suits your style. It can be an actual tree branch, which gives a natural look, or you can use a wire coat hanger bent into the shape of a tree.</li><li>If using a branch, place it in a small vase or pot. Fill the pot with rocks or gravel to secure the branch in place.</li><li>If using a wire frame, shape it into a tree-like structure, then secure it in a pot or base.</li><li>Optionally, paint the branch or wire to match your room&rsquo;s décor.</li><li>Hang your necklaces, bracelets, and earrings from the branches. This makes for a beautiful and functional display, allowing you to easily see and access your jewelry.</li></ol><p>This DIY jewelry tree is not only a great organizational tool but also adds a rustic, boho charm to any room.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>With a little creativity, you can easily organize your jewelry collection without breaking the bank. Whether you&rsquo;re upcycling old furniture, creating custom jewelry displays, or crafting portable storage solutions, DIY jewelry storage is both a practical and enjoyable project. These ideas not only help you keep your jewelry neat and organized, but they also allow you to showcase your pieces in a way that adds style and personality to your space.</p><p>Choose a solution that fits your needs and personal style, and soon you’ll have an organized jewelry collection that’s easy to access and display.
