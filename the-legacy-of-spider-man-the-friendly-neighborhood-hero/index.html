This post explores the enduring legacy of Spider-Man, delving into his origins, character development, cultural impact, and the timeless themes that continue to resonate with fans around the world.</p><h2 id=origins-of-spider-man>Origins of Spider-Man</h2><p>The story of Spider-Man begins with a young man named Peter Parker, an ordinary high school student living in New York City. Peter’s life takes a dramatic turn when he is bitten by a radioactive spider during a school field trip.
