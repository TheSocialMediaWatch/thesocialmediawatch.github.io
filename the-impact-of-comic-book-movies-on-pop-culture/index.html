These movies have not only given underrepresented communities a chance to see themselves represented on the big screen but have also opened up important conversations about representation in the media.</p><p>Comic book movies have become a platform for social commentary, addressing relevant issues and challenging societal norms. Films like &ldquo;Black Panther&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wonder Woman&rdquo; have shown the power of representation and the impact it can have on audiences around the world.
