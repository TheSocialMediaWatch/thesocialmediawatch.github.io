It’s recommended to upload WAV files for the best sound quality.</li><li><strong>Master Your Tracks</strong>: Ensure that your tracks are mixed and mastered for optimal sound. This step can be done by hiring a professional engineer or using mastering software.</li><li><strong>Metadata</strong>: Include accurate metadata, such as song titles, artist name, album name, and genre. This information will help listeners find your music and ensure that you get the correct royalties.</li><li><strong>Artwork</strong>: Most streaming services require album artwork that meets specific guidelines, such as a minimum size of 3000x3000 pixels. Your artwork should visually represent your music and brand.</li></ul><h3 id=2-choose-a-digital-distribution-service>2. Choose a Digital Distribution Service</h3><p>Once your music is ready, you’ll need to use a digital distribution service to get it on Spotify, Apple Music, and other streaming platforms. These services act as intermediaries between you and the streaming platforms, ensuring that your music is uploaded correctly and that you receive your earnings.</p><h4 id=popular-distribution-services-include>Popular Distribution Services Include:</h4><ul><li><strong>DistroKid</strong>: One of the most popular distribution services, DistroKid allows you to upload unlimited tracks for an annual fee.
