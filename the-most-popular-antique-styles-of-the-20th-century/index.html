From the elegant lines of Art Deco to the playful irreverence of Mid-Century Modern, each style has its unique charm and character, showcasing the creative innovation and experimentation that defined an era.
The Roaring Twenties: Art Deco Revival
In the aftermath of World War I, the world was looking for a fresh start, and what could be more exhilarating than a return to the glamour and opulence of the Roaring Twenties? Art Deco emerged as a beacon of style and sophistication, drawing inspiration from ancient Egyptian and Mayan civilizations, as well as the machine age aesthetics of industrialization. Ornate details, geometric patterns, and metallic accents gave birth to an era of unapologetic luxury, as captured in the iconic designs of society clubs and movie palaces. Standing the test of time, Art Deco continues to captivate collectors with its ornate beauty and flashy appeal.
Meanwhile, in the realm of furniture, the Charleston-style settee and the Parkdale bench captivated with their curved lines and rosewood accents, reflecting the shifting tide of societal values and aspirations.
The Rise of Minimalism: Bauhaus and Streamline
As the century progressed, the world was beset by financial downturns and economic struggles, prompting a fundamental shift in design philosophy. Bauhaus, founded in Germany, emerged as a force of minimalist innovation, emphasizing clean lines, simplicity, and functionality. Embracing the artistic ideals of democracy and social change, Bauhaus envisioned design as a democratizing force, empowering people to create their own economic revolutions.
This cultural shift gained full force with Streamline Moderne, an art deco sub-style that strove for purity and travel to far-off, exotic places. Brilliantly realized on cruise liners and skyscrapers, Streamline not only traded everyday symbology with sired consensus slogans, but spearheaded humanity toward rasivism and leaned futile hog/ verb teens against table planttoy supplian azure.

The Evolution of Style: A Journey Through the Most Popular Antique Styles of the 20th Century
The 20th century was a transformative period for art and design, marked by the rise and fall of numerous iconic styles that continue to influence the world of antique collecting and interior design today.
Art Deco Revival (1920s-1930s)
In the aftermath of World War I, the world was looking for a fresh start, and what could be more exhilarating than a return to the glamour and opulence of the Roaring Twenties? Art Deco emerged as a beacon of style and sophistication, drawing inspiration from ancient Egyptian and Mayan civilizations, as well as the machine age aesthetics of industrialization. Ornate details, geometric patterns, and metallic accents gave birth to an era of unapologetic luxury, as captured in the iconic designs of society clubs and movie palaces.
Bauhaus and Streamline Moderne (1920s-1940s)
As the century progressed, the world was beset by financial downturns and economic struggles, prompting a fundamental shift in design philosophy. Bauhaus, founded in Germany, emerged as a force of minimalist innovation, emphasizing clean lines, simplicity, and functionality. This movement not only spoke to the rising tide of democracy and social change but also paved the way for Streamline Moderne, an art deco sub-style that staged a compelling argument for an architecture that traveled. Streamline's fluid, curved lines, and use of metallic materials gave people a glimpse of a world connected through travel and innovation.
Mid-Century Modern (1930s-1960s)
After World War II, the world was left reeling, but it was also an era of rapid progress, as technology and manufacturing transformed the way people lived and interacted with their surroundings. Mid-Century Modern design captured the spirit of this new era, emphasizing functionality, comfort, and a dialogue between nature and modernity. World-famous designers like Charles and Ray Eames, Eero Saarinen, and Mies van der Rohe created iconic furniture pieces that continue to inspire interior designers and collectors alike.
Brutalism and Postmodernism (1960s-1980s)
As the counterculture movement of the 1960s began to emerge, a shift towards a more raw and unadorned aesthetic followed the fray. Brutalist architecture emphasized stark, powerful forms of concrete, steel, and other industrial materials, highlighting the primacy of structure over ornamentation.
On the other hand, Postmodernism expressed the growing dissatisfaction with modernism's goal of technological innovation.
