These sites cleverly craft content that teeters between absurdity and social commentary, offering laughs while often shedding light on societal truths. Whether you&rsquo;re in need of witty parody or biting critique, these ten satirical sites prove there&rsquo;s no shortage of creativity when it comes to poking fun at the news cycle. Here are 10 satirical news websites you should bookmark today.</p><hr><h2 id=1-the-onion>1. The Onion</h2><p>Arguably the most well-known satirical news outlet, <strong>The Onion</strong> has been delivering sharp, tongue-in-cheek articles since 1988.

It&rsquo;s perfect for anyone who loves satire that’s both laugh-out-loud funny and subtly insightful.</p><hr><h2 id=2-clickhole>2. ClickHole</h2><p>Spun off from The Onion, <strong>ClickHole</strong> takes aim at the internet culture of mindless viral content. From clickbait-style headlines like &ldquo;You Won’t Believe What This Walrus Did To Preserve Its Legacy&rdquo; to completely outlandish quizzes, ClickHole mimics the tone and substance of viral websites with uncanny precision. The result? Satirical articles that make you laugh <em>and</em> question why you ever fell for similar content in the first place.</p><h3 id=why-bookmark-it-1>Why bookmark it?</h3><p>If you’re someone who gets bombarded with clickbait headlines daily, ClickHole offers an exaggerated—but wildly entertaining—reminder to think twice before clicking.</p><hr><h2 id=3-reductress>3.

The Beaverton</h2><p>For those who love satire with a Canadian twist, <strong>The Beaverton</strong> is your go-to site. While it covers global topics, its humor leans heavily into Canadian culture and politics. Articles like &ldquo;Toronto Man Shocked to Learn He’s Not Actually Liberal After Visiting Alberta&rdquo; or &ldquo;Canadians Enthusiastically Returning to Seasonal Hobby of Complaining About Winter&rdquo; find hilarity in small, uniquely Canadian truths.</p><h3 id=why-bookmark-it-3>Why bookmark it?</h3><p>The Beaverton will make you laugh while subtly educating readers about the nuances of Canadian life and global matters—all with razor-sharp satire.</p><hr><h2 id=5-the-daily-mash>5.

Babylon Bee</h2><p><strong>Babylon Bee</strong> has carved its niche as a satirical news site with a focus on conservative culture and religious humor. The site targets absurdities in faith-based communities, politics, and pop culture. Headlines like &ldquo;Maintenance Man Asks God To Change That One Light Bulb Way Up High&rdquo; blend humor with commentary on modern Christianity and evangelicalism.</p><h3 id=why-bookmark-it-6>Why bookmark it?</h3><p>Babylon Bee offers a different lens on satire, appealing especially to those interested in faith-based humor intertwined with comedy.</p><hr><h2 id=8-the-poke>8. The Poke</h2><p>Self-described as the &ldquo;UK&rsquo;s leading purveyors of topical hilarity,&rdquo; <strong>The Poke</strong> features clever takes on everything from banal reality TV moments to shockingly tone-deaf celebrity comments. Unlike other sites, The Poke often features a mix of original content and curated viral memes that enhance its comedic output.</p><h3 id=why-bookmark-it-7>Why bookmark it?</h3><p>If you’re a fan of quick humor combined with the best of internet culture, The Poke is ideal for basking in laughs while scrolling.</p><hr><h2 id=9-duffel-blog>9.

The Civilian</h2><p>Rounding out the list is <strong>The Civilian</strong>, New Zealand&rsquo;s answer to satire. While its coverage of New Zealand politics and culture takes center stage, The Civilian also dips into global topics with hilarious headlines like &ldquo;Government Admits Housing Crisis Was Just Elaborate Test of New Zealanders’ Resilience.&rdquo;</p><h3 id=why-bookmark-it-9>Why bookmark it?</h3><p>For a mix of cleverness and culturally specific humor, The Civilian delivers unique satire for readers in New Zealand and beyond.</p><hr><h2 id=the-role-of-satire-in-informing-through-humor>The Role of Satire in Informing Through Humor</h2><p>Though these websites primarily aim to entertain, their role in modern media is often underestimated. Satirical articles don’t just make us laugh—they hold up a mirror to society, politics, and culture, encouraging critical thinking while exposing absurdities. A well-crafted joke can sometimes convey truths better than a thousand earnest headlines.</p><p>While bookmarking these ten websites may not replace your usual news consumption, it will ensure your humor quota remains fully stacked. Whether it’s politics, pop culture, or societal quirks, satirical news offers a way to laugh while gaining perspective. Dive in, scroll away, and enjoy the clever world of fake news crafted to highlight life’s oddities.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://various.googlexy.com/categories/comedy-and-satire/>Comedy and Satire</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://various.googlexy.com/10-satirical-instagram-accounts-you-should-follow/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>10 Satirical Instagram Accounts You Should Follow</span>
