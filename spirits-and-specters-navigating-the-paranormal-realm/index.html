They are often depicted as lingering souls that have not transitioned peacefully to the afterlife. While the term &ldquo;ghost&rdquo; is frequently used interchangeably with &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; it is important to note that not all spirits are specters. Specters may be tied to specific locations, events, or individuals, and their appearances are often associated with unfinished business or unresolved issues from their lives.</p><h2 id=the-historical-context-of-spirits-and-specters>The Historical Context of Spirits and Specters</h2><p>Throughout history, cultures have constructed various narratives to explain the presence of spirits and specters.
