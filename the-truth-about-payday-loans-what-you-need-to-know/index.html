While they may seem like a quick fix for financial emergencies, the harsh reality is that payday loans can often exacerbate financial problems rather than solve them.

The Rise of the Payday Lending Industry
In the past few decades, the payday lending industry has grown steadily, with thousands of storefronts popping up across the United States alone. According to a recent study, Americans borrowed over $29 billion from predatory lenders in 2012, with the average borrower taking out multiple loans in a single year. The overwhelming demand for these loans has led to the establishment of numerous online payday lenders, making it easier than ever for consumers to access these short-term credits.
