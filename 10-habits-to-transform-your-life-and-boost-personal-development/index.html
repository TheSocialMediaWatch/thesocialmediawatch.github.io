Write them down, break them into smaller tasks, and review them regularly to stay on track.</p><h3 id=why-it-works>Why It Works</h3><p>Setting clear goals helps clarify your priorities and motivates you to take action. When you have a clear vision of what you want to achieve, your mind becomes focused, and you’re less likely to get distracted by unimportant tasks.</p><h2 id=2-practice-mindfulness>2.
