The first major event often cited is the 1939 World Science Fiction Convention, which laid the groundwork for what would later become numerous genre-specific festivals.</p><p>From these humble beginnings, conventions matured into multifaceted events encompassing movies, television, video games, anime, cosplay, tabletop gaming, and more. Today, they are vibrant melting pots where entertainers, artists, writers, and fans converge to celebrate their shared passions. The growth in popularity also mirrors the rise of pop culture&rsquo;s prominence in mainstream media, making conventions cultural phenomena that influence broader trends.</p><h2 id=what-makes-pop-culture-conventions-so-captivating>What Makes Pop Culture Conventions So Captivating?</h2><p>At their core, pop culture conventions serve as a haven where fans can immerse themselves in worlds they adore, meet like-minded individuals, and partake in experiences unavailable elsewhere.
