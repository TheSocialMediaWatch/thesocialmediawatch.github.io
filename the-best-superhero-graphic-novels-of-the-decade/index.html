by Saladin Ahmed and Andrés Genolet</strong></h2><p>Following the success of Kamala Khan’s debut series, <em>Beyond the Limit</em> continues exploring her place in the multiverse alongside new challenges and villains, reflecting the growing complexity of modern superhero narratives.</p><p>Saladin Ahmed’s writing ventures into cosmic storytelling while maintaining strong character development and cultural nuance.</p><p>Andrés Genolet’s art captures high-stakes action with fluidity and vibrant colors, elevating the series to both critical and fan acclaim.</p><p>This continuation solidifies Ms. Marvel&rsquo;s status as not only a cultural icon but also as an evolving hero within superhero graphic novels.</p><hr><h2 id=8-gotham-central-by-ed-brubaker-greg-rucka-and-michael-lark>8. <strong>&ldquo;Gotham Central&rdquo;

by Samira Ahmed and Andrés Genolet</strong></h2><p>Expanding on Kamala’s journey, <em>The New World</em> explores her identity shifts and the responsibilities she faces as part of a larger superhero community while managing the dynamics of her personal life.</p><p>This phase brings fresh perspectives on social justice and activism, tightly interweaving relevant real-world issues with classic superhero arcs.</p><p>The artistic execution remains dynamic, using inventive panel layouts and a vibrant color scheme that highlights the emotional narrative beats.</p><p>This work exemplifies the emotional growth and expanded horizons that contemporary superhero graphic novels foreground.</p><hr><h2 id=10-invincible-by-robert-kirkman-and-cory-walker--ryan-ottley>10. <strong>&ldquo;Invincible&rdquo;
