This objectivity often leads to a richer, more nuanced understanding of the famous person&rsquo;s life.</p><p>Reading biographies allows readers to witness the evolution of character and ideas, discover hidden facets of influential people, and learn lessons in leadership, creativity, resilience, and morality. They humanize those often perceived as icons, showing they faced doubts, failures, and challenges just like anyone else.</p><h2 id=top-biographies-that-are-must-reads>Top Biographies That Are Must-Reads</h2><h3 id=1-steve-jobs-by-walter-isaacson>1. <strong>“Steve Jobs” by Walter Isaacson</strong></h3><p>Walter Isaacson’s biography of Steve Jobs is a masterclass in storytelling and in-depth research.
