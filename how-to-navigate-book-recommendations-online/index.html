Take advantage of these lists to discover new reads.</p></li></ul><h3 id=book-recommendation-websites>Book Recommendation Websites</h3><p>Several websites specialize in providing book recommendations based on your preferences. Here are a few notable ones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Goodreads</strong>: A social platform for readers, Goodreads allows you to track your reading, rate books, and receive personalized recommendations based on your reading history.
