Reading ignites the mind, fosters empathy, and promotes relaxation. Consistent reading reduces stress by lowering heart rates and easing muscle tension, providing a natural escape from daily pressures. Moreover, self-help or psychology-centered books initially equip readers with practical strategies to manage their thoughts and emotions—but beyond that, inspiring memoirs and narratives can reshape mental frameworks by showing human resilience in action.</p><p>Whether you are looking for scientific insight, therapeutic exercises, or heartfelt stories that remind you you’re not alone, the following books cover all these angles.</p><h2 id=best-books-to-support-mental-health-growth>Best Books to Support Mental Health Growth</h2><h3 id=1-the-body-keeps-the-score-by-bessel-van-der-kolk>1. <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> by Bessel van der Kolk</h3><p>A seminal work in trauma psychology, <em>The Body Keeps the Score</em> reveals how trauma reshapes both the body and brain.
