The turn-based gameplay allows players to think through each move at their own pace, and the interface is streamlined with helpful tooltips that guide decision-making.</p><p>In <em>Civilization VI</em>, players oversee the rise of a civilization from a humble settlement to a global empire. You&rsquo;ll juggle exploration, city-building, diplomacy, and military conquest. The game adapts to your style, whether you favor aggressive expansion or peaceful development.</p><p>Various difficulty levels and customizable game lengths make it easy to hop into a quick session or a marathon campaign.
