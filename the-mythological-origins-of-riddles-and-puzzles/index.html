The riddle, &ldquo;What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?&rdquo; stumped all who attempted to solve it. Oedipus, the legendary hero, eventually answered correctly, declaring that it was a human being, who crawls on all fours as a baby, walks on two legs as an adult, and uses a cane in old age. This myth highlights the intricate connection between riddles and mythology, as well as the significance of wit and intelligence in overcoming challenges.</p><h2 id=norse-mythology-and-riddles>Norse Mythology and Riddles</h2><p>In Norse mythology, the god Odin was known for his wisdom and cunning, often depicted as a seeker of knowledge.

In a battle of wits, the two engaged in a series of riddles, with Odin disguising himself as Gagnrad, a wanderer seeking to test the giant&rsquo;s knowledge.
