Over the years, the medium has evolved, giving rise to a wealth of animated shows and films that cater specifically to adults. Thanks to streaming platforms like Netflix, these animated masterpieces have reached a wider audience, offering everything from dark humor and political commentary to heartfelt stories and complex characters.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re an adult looking for the best cartoons on Netflix that don&rsquo;t shy away from tackling mature themes, you&rsquo;ve come to the right place. Whether you&rsquo;re seeking something thought-provoking, hilarious, or a bit offbeat, Netflix has a variety of adult cartoons that can cater to your tastes.</p><h3 id=1-bojack-horseman>1. <strong>BoJack Horseman</strong></h3><p>One of the most iconic adult animated shows on Netflix, <em>BoJack Horseman</em> blends humor with deep emotional complexity. The show centers on BoJack, a washed-up 90s sitcom star who is also a talking horse, and his journey through life as he grapples with addiction, depression, and his own self-worth.</p><p>With a unique animation style that brings out both the absurdity and emotional weight of the show, <em>BoJack Horseman</em> touches on issues like mental health, the pursuit of happiness, fame, and personal redemption. The show is famous for its witty dialogues, innovative storytelling, and the way it seamlessly combines dark humor with poignant, real-life situations.</p><p>Whether it&rsquo;s through its satire of Hollywood or its portrayal of flawed characters, <em>BoJack Horseman</em> manages to push the boundaries of what adult animation can do, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates deep, introspective humor.</p><h3 id=2-rick-and-morty>2. <strong>Rick and Morty</strong></h3><p>If you&rsquo;re into sci-fi, dark comedy, and existential exploration, <em>Rick and Morty</em> is one of the best options available on Netflix. The series, created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, follows the wild and often chaotic adventures of Rick Sanchez, an eccentric, alcoholic scientist, and his good-hearted but easily influenced grandson, Morty.</p><p>The show’s humor is fast-paced and filled with pop culture references, but it’s the underlying philosophical and existential themes that make <em>Rick and Morty</em> stand out. The show delves into the meaning of life, the universe, and everything in between, all while maintaining an irreverent tone. It’s one of those shows that blends absurdity with moments of profound insight, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats while making them think.</p><p>With its clever writing, clever social commentary, and truly unique animation style, <em>Rick and Morty</em> has earned a dedicated fanbase. It&rsquo;s a cartoon that appeals to those who enjoy not just outrageous humor, but also intellectually stimulating storytelling.</p><h3 id=3-big-mouth>3. <strong>Big Mouth</strong></h3><p>For a more crass yet hilarious look at the awkward stages of adolescence, <em>Big Mouth</em> is the perfect choice. Created by Nick Kroll, Andrew Goldberg, Mark Levin, and Jennifer Flackett, this animated series explores the tumultuous world of puberty through the eyes of a group of pre-teens and their hormone monsters.</p><p><em>Big Mouth</em> is unapologetically explicit and doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the uncomfortable realities of growing up. It tackles topics such as body image, sexuality, relationships, and the often awkward conversations that come with puberty. Despite its raunchy humor, the show also provides some surprisingly heartwarming moments, offering a deeper reflection on the struggles of adolescence.</p><p>The show&rsquo;s voice cast includes Nick Kroll, John Mulaney, and Maya Rudolph, whose performances help elevate the series&rsquo; humor. <em>Big Mouth</em> is both ridiculous and relatable, making it a must-watch for anyone who enjoys adult cartoons with a mix of crude humor and thoughtful commentary.</p><h3 id=4-f-is-for-family>4. <strong>F Is for Family</strong></h3><p>Set in the 1970s, <em>F Is for Family</em> is an animated sitcom that takes a no-holds-barred look at family life, societal expectations, and the frustrations of growing up in an era that now feels like ancient history. Created by Bill Burr, who also voices the lead character, Frank Murphy, the show is a biting commentary on traditional family dynamics and the struggles of being a father.</p><p>The humor in <em>F Is for Family</em> is raw and unapologetic, much like the characters it portrays. Frank Murphy is a hot-tempered, often clueless father trying to maintain some semblance of order in his dysfunctional family. The show is a hilarious and at times poignant reflection of a different era, filled with plenty of sharp wit, irreverent humor, and a lot of heart.</p><p>The series explores themes of anger, frustration, and love within the confines of a family, all while making you laugh out loud. If you&rsquo;re a fan of dark humor and nostalgia for the 1970s, <em>F Is for Family</em> is one of the best adult animated series available on Netflix.</p><h3 id=5-disenchantment>5. <strong>Disenchantment</strong></h3><p>From Matt Groening, the creator of <em>The Simpsons</em> and <em>Futurama</em>, comes <em>Disenchantment</em>, an adult animated series that blends fantasy, adventure, and comedy. Set in the medieval kingdom of Dreamland, the show follows Princess Bean, her elf companion Elfo, and their ogre sidekick Luci, as they navigate the trials and tribulations of life in a fantastical world.</p><p>While the show shares some of the signature humor from Groening’s previous works, <em>Disenchantment</em> brings a fresh, more fantastical setting that allows for a different kind of storytelling. The series incorporates magical elements, political intrigue, and satirical takes on fantasy tropes. But at its heart, it’s a show about personal growth, friendship, and finding one’s purpose in life.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of Groening&rsquo;s work and enjoy animated series with a sense of whimsy and absurdity, <em>Disenchantment</em> is a great pick. It offers a unique blend of humor, adventure, and an ensemble of eccentric characters that make it stand out among other adult cartoons on Netflix.</p><h3 id=6-bojack-horseman>6. <strong>Bojack Horseman</strong></h3><p>As an animated show that continuously blurs the line between comedy and drama, <em>BoJack Horseman</em> features complex, flawed characters that grow throughout the series, much like those found in live-action dramas. The series’ ability to balance dark themes, such as addiction, mental health, and the destructive nature of fame, with comedic satire is a major reason why it is often considered one of the best adult cartoons on Netflix.</p><p>One of the key strengths of <em>BoJack Horseman</em> is its willingness to approach difficult and sometimes taboo subjects with sensitivity and nuance, giving it depth beyond the typical animated show. Characters like BoJack, Diane, Mr. Peanutbutter, and Todd each have their own arcs that explore various aspects of life, making the show feel incredibly grounded despite its fantastical premise.</p><p>The animation itself is visually stunning, with its blend of dark humor and melancholic moments creating a tone that is unique in the world of adult animation. Whether you’re laughing at BoJack’s sarcastic remarks or contemplating the show’s deeper messages, <em>BoJack Horseman</em> is a must-watch for adults who appreciate animation with substance.</p><h3 id=7-tuca--bertie>7. <strong>Tuca & Bertie</strong></h3><p>If you’re looking for an adult animated show with a quirky, surreal style, <em>Tuca & Bertie</em> might be just what you need. Created by Lisa Hanawalt, a former <em>BoJack Horseman</em> producer, this show follows the lives of two anthropomorphic bird women—Tuca, a free-spirited toucan, and Bertie, a more reserved and neurotic songbird.</p><p><em>Tuca & Bertie</em> stands out for its vibrant animation and its exploration of female friendship, mental health, and the challenges of adulthood. The show doesn’t shy away from tough topics like anxiety, body image, and career struggles, all while maintaining a sense of humor and whimsy. The surreal visuals and bold color schemes add to the dreamlike quality of the series, making it feel fresh and distinct from other adult cartoons.</p><p>At its core, <em>Tuca & Bertie</em> is about the complexity of adult friendships, personal growth, and finding one&rsquo;s place in the world. It’s a visually stunning, emotionally charged show that resonates with viewers on a personal level, making it one of the best adult animated series on Netflix.</p><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>Netflix has become a hub for adult animation, offering a wide range of shows that cater to different tastes, moods, and interests. Whether you&rsquo;re into dark humor, heartfelt drama, or absurd adventure, there’s something for everyone. Shows like <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, <em>Rick and Morty</em>, and <em>Big Mouth</em> are all excellent examples of how animation can transcend its traditional audience, offering something unique for adults.</p><p>These cartoons are more than just entertainment—they tackle real-world issues, explore complex emotions, and push the boundaries of storytelling.
