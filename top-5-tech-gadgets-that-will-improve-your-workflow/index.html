Whether you&rsquo;re coding, working on design projects, or managing a hefty email inbox, having multiple screens can drastically improve your productivity.</p><p>Portable monitors are a game-changer for anyone who needs extra screen space but doesn’t want to carry a bulky desktop setup or a heavy laptop. These compact monitors connect easily to your laptop or tablet, providing a second screen that you can take anywhere. Most models are lightweight and powered through a USB-C connection, which makes them easy to set up and use.</p><p>The ability to work on two or more screens simultaneously is a huge productivity booster.
