The boundaries of creativity, storytelling, and visual aesthetics have been stretched, redefined, and revolutionized in ways that weren’t even imaginable a decade ago. From the rise of bold, experimental storytelling to a more inclusive approach to representation, the last decade has witnessed the emergence of some of the most daring, inventive, and thought-provoking cartoons ever produced. This post explores the most creative cartoons of the last decade, highlighting how they’ve shaped not only the animation industry but also pop culture as a whole.</p><h2 id=the-golden-age-of-animation>The Golden Age of Animation</h2><p>While animation has always been an essential part of the entertainment landscape, the past decade has ushered in what could be considered a second golden age. This period has been marked by a diverse range of animated shows that are not just for children but for audiences of all ages, tackling themes that were once deemed too complex for animated formats.</p><p>Animation has become a platform for the exploration of deeper societal issues, personal growth, and even philosophical musings, often wrapped in humor or abstract concepts. With streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ dominating the market, the freedom of creative expression is at an all-time high, allowing animators to break free from traditional norms.</p><h3 id=1-adventure-time-2010-2018>1. <strong>Adventure Time</strong> (2010-2018)</h3><p>One of the most groundbreaking animated series of the past decade, <em>Adventure Time</em> was not just a quirky show about a boy and his dog adventuring in a post-apocalyptic world. It transcended its whimsical premise to explore themes of loneliness, mental health, existentialism, and the passage of time. The show’s ability to balance absurdity with emotional depth made it a cultural phenomenon, loved by both children and adults.</p><p>The artistry of <em>Adventure Time</em> was equally revolutionary. The animation style was simple yet striking, utilizing bold colors and minimalist design, while the storytelling was inventive, often subverting typical narrative structures. It was a show that wasn’t afraid to take risks and was celebrated for its unconventional approach to both humor and drama.</p><h3 id=2-bojack-horseman-2014-2020>2. <strong>BoJack Horseman</strong> (2014-2020)</h3><p><em>BoJack Horseman</em> is a masterpiece of dark humor and sharp satire, wrapped in a package that, on the surface, looks like a typical adult animated show. However, its exploration of mental health, addiction, self-worth, and personal responsibility set it apart from anything else in the genre. Created by Raphael Bob-Waksberg, the series follows the washed-up star BoJack, a horse who was once the star of a &rsquo;90s sitcom, as he navigates the complexities of life in Hollywood.</p><p>The show’s narrative style was both tragic and hilarious, providing an unflinching look at the flaws and imperfections of its characters. Visually, <em>BoJack Horseman</em> took full advantage of the medium, often using surreal and psychedelic imagery to enhance its emotional moments. It wasn’t just a comedy show; it was a poignant meditation on the human condition, making it one of the most creative and ambitious cartoons of the decade.</p><h3 id=3-steven-universe-2013-2020>3. <strong>Steven Universe</strong> (2013-2020)</h3><p><em>Steven Universe</em> is a testament to how animation can be used as a platform for inclusivity and progressive storytelling. Created by Rebecca Sugar, it tells the story of Steven, a young boy who discovers that he is part of a team of magical beings known as the Crystal Gems. What sets this show apart is its deep exploration of identity, relationships, and the complexities of gender and sexuality.</p><p>One of the most striking aspects of <em>Steven Universe</em> was its ability to depict nuanced, diverse characters without resorting to stereotypes. The show became a beacon for LGBTQ+ representation in children’s television, with its portrayal of romantic relationships and self-discovery offering a sense of validation for many young viewers. The animation itself was vibrant and imaginative, with a unique style that was both whimsical and emotionally resonant.</p><h3 id=4-rick-and-morty-2013-present>4. <strong>Rick and Morty</strong> (2013-present)</h3><p>Since its debut, <em>Rick and Morty</em> has pushed the envelope on what animated television can be. Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon, the show blends science fiction, absurdity, and dark humor to create a universe that is as intellectually stimulating as it is chaotic. The premise follows Rick, a mad scientist, and his good-hearted but easily influenced grandson, Morty, as they embark on interdimensional adventures.</p><p>What makes <em>Rick and Morty</em> stand out is its ability to balance high-concept science fiction with deeply personal stories. The show explores existentialism, nihilism, and the complexity of human relationships, all while making you laugh at its bizarre antics. Its animation is unconventional, featuring a distinctive style that complements its offbeat humor and philosophical musings.</p><h3 id=5-the-owl-house-2020-2023>5. <strong>The Owl House</strong> (2020-2023)</h3><p><em>The Owl House</em> emerged as one of the most imaginative and inclusive animated series of the past decade. Created by Dana Terrace, the show follows Luz, a teenage girl who stumbles upon a portal to another world where she befriends a rebellious witch and her misfit crew. The series is set in a magical world that is as rich in lore as it is in visual beauty, drawing from various mythologies and cultures.</p><p>What truly sets <em>The Owl House</em> apart is its unapologetic commitment to LGBTQ+ representation. Luz&rsquo;s journey of self-discovery and her relationships with other characters, including the witch Amity, were groundbreaking for children’s television. The show’s creative world-building, coupled with its deep emotional storytelling, made it one of the most beloved animated series in recent years.</p><h3 id=6-big-mouth-2017-present>6. <strong>Big Mouth</strong> (2017-present)</h3><p><em>Big Mouth</em> is an animated series that dares to tackle topics that are often seen as taboo in mainstream media—namely, puberty, sexuality, and the awkwardness of growing up. Created by Nick Kroll, Andrew Goldberg, Mark Levin, and Jennifer Flackett, the show follows a group of preteens navigating the challenges of adolescence with the help of their hormone monsters.</p><p>Despite its crude humor, <em>Big Mouth</em> is an insightful exploration of the confusion and chaos that come with puberty. It’s an honest and often uncomfortable look at the trials of growing up, and its willingness to address topics like body image, mental health, and sexual identity with humor and sensitivity made it one of the most creative and controversial cartoons of the decade.</p><h3 id=7-undone-2019-present>7. <strong>Undone</strong> (2019-present)</h3><p><em>Undone</em> is an animated series that blends live-action with rotoscope animation, creating a visually stunning and innovative narrative. The show, created by Kate Purdy and Raphael Bob-Waksberg (of <em>BoJack Horseman</em> fame), follows Alma, a woman who discovers she has the ability to manipulate time after a near-death experience. As she delves deeper into her newfound abilities, she begins to uncover truths about her father’s mysterious death.</p><p>The unique animation style of <em>Undone</em> enhances the show’s surreal and psychological elements, making it feel like a dreamlike experience. The series explores themes of trauma, grief, and the malleability of time, all while pushing the boundaries of what animated storytelling can achieve.</p><h3 id=8-the-midnight-gospel-2020>8. <strong>The Midnight Gospel</strong> (2020)</h3><p>Created by Pendleton Ward (creator of <em>Adventure Time</em>) and Duncan Trussell, <em>The Midnight Gospel</em> is an animated series that combines philosophy, existential musings, and psychedelic visuals into a narrative that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating. The show follows Clancy, a space-traveling podcaster, who interviews beings from other dimensions while exploring themes of life, death, and everything in between.</p><p>What makes <em>The Midnight Gospel</em> unique is its ability to merge heavy, introspective dialogue with absurdist animation. The show’s visual style is wildly creative, with each episode offering a new, bizarre world that complements the deep, thought-provoking conversations. <em>The Midnight Gospel</em> is a perfect example of how animation can be used as a vehicle for exploring profound, abstract concepts.</p><h3 id=9-tuca--bertie-2019-2020>9. <strong>Tuca & Bertie</strong> (2019-2020)</h3><p>Created by Lisa Hanawalt, the mind behind <em>BoJack Horseman</em>, <em>Tuca & Bertie</em> tells the story of two anthropomorphized birds navigating the ups and downs of their lives in a vibrant, surreal world. The show explores themes of female friendship, mental health, and self-discovery, all while maintaining a distinctly whimsical and offbeat sense of humor.</p><p>The animation in <em>Tuca & Bertie</em> is visually striking, with bold colors and inventive designs that make the show stand out from other animated series. Its quirky, yet emotionally resonant storytelling, combined with its unique art style, made it one of the most innovative and creative cartoons of the past decade.</p><h3 id=10-kipo-and-the-age-of-the-wonderbeasts-2020>10. <strong>Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts</strong> (2020)</h3><p><em>Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts</em> is a post-apocalyptic animated series that takes place in a world where humans have been forced to live underground due to the rise of giant mutant animals. Created by Radford Sechrist, the show follows Kipo, a young girl who emerges from the underground to discover a world teeming with creatures, both dangerous and friendly.</p><p>The series is notable for its colorful, futuristic animation style, which blends vibrant designs with a rich narrative about friendship, survival, and the power of community. The show also explores important themes such as environmentalism, inclusivity, and identity, making it not only a visually stunning series but a socially conscious one as well.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The last decade has undoubtedly seen the rise of some of the most creative, innovative, and daring animated series to date. These cartoons have pushed the boundaries of animation, storytelling, and representation, offering something for everyone—whether it&rsquo;s deep philosophical musings, emotional depth, or simply pure, unadulterated fun. As we look to the future, one can only imagine what new frontiers animation will explore, but the creativity of the past decade has laid an inspiring foundation for what’s to come.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://various.googlexy.com/categories/cartoons/>Cartoons</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://various.googlexy.com/the-most-creative-cartoon-art-styles-explained/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Most Creative Cartoon Art Styles Explained</span>
