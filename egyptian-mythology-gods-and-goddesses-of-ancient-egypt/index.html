Often depicted with outstretched wings, Isis was known for her nurturing nature and protective powers. She played a crucial role in the Osiris myth, where she resurrected her husband Osiris and gave birth to Horus, the falcon-headed god of kingship.</p><h2 id=anubis-the-god-of-embalming>Anubis, the God of Embalming</h2><p>Anubis, with his jackal head, was the god of embalming and the protector of graves in ancient Egypt. He guided the souls of the deceased through the afterlife and presided over the mummification process.
