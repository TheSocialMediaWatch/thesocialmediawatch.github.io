Every year, new trends emerge, and classic cocktails are revisited with a modern twist. But what's currently hot in the world of mixology? Let's take a deep dive into the latest developments and discuss the flavors, techniques, and ingredients that are captivating the spirits industry.
The Rise of Low- and No-Proof Cocktails
In response to the growing demand for low- and no-proof drinks, bartenders have been experimenting with ingredients like teas, tonics, and infusions to create low-proof cocktails. This trend is driven by the increasing popularity of wellness-focused drinks and the desire for lighter, more approachable options. By using juices, syrups, and essences, bar owners and mixologists are crafting unique cocktails that are just as flavorful as their full-proof counterparts but with much lower ABV.
One notable example is the popularity of Spirits-Free Zone, a concept that emphasizes drinkable, low-proof creations using fresh juices, infusions, and extracts. This trend has inspired a new wave of 'Association Tasting Competitions,' where bartenders showcase their skills in creating innovative, low-proof cocktails. Soft-drink-inspired cocktails are also on the rise, incorporating techniques like brewing and carbonation to mimic the textures and flavors of low-proof drinks. This push towards lighter, approachable options revolutionizes the classic cocktail canon and is opening up new possibilities for the mixology world.
The Flavor Profiles of Asia-Paciic Mixology
Asia-Pacific, particularly Japan, Australia, and the Americas, have become hotbeds for innovative mixology. It seems that drinks with Geisha-esque underpinnings - that showcase zesty flavors, subtly sweet notes, and floral aromas - are among the most sought-after.
