His most famous deed was single-handedly defending Ulster against the forces of Queen Medb of Connacht during the Táin Bó Cúailnge, a great cattle raid.</p><p>One of Cú Chulainn&rsquo;s defining characteristics was his ríastrad, or battle frenzy.

He was a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield, striking fear into the hearts of his enemies.</p><p>But Cú Chulainn was not without his flaws. His arrogance and pride often led to his downfall.

She was a force of nature, embodying the power of the land and its connection to its people.</p><h2 id=the-táin-bó-cúailnge-the-cattle-raid-of-cooley>The Táin Bó Cúailnge: The Cattle Raid of Cooley</h2><p>The Táin Bó Cúailnge is a legendary epic that tells the story of a great cattle raid led by Queen Medb of Connacht. The raid was prompted by Medb&rsquo;s desire to match the wealth of her husband, King Ailill, by acquiring the prized bull of Cooley, Donn Cúailnge.</p><p>In this epic tale, Cú Chulainn stands as the champion of Ulster, defending his homeland against the invading forces.
