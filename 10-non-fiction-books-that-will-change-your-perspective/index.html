Kahneman’s insights into cognitive biases and decision-making processes not only challenge how we perceive the world but also how we interact with it. This book encourages readers to examine their thought processes and develop a more critical approach to their choices.</p><h2 id=2-sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind-by-yuval-noah-harari>2. <strong>Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari</strong></h2><p>In <em>Sapiens</em>, Yuval Noah Harari takes readers on a sweeping journey through the history of our species.

This book is a must-read for anyone looking to break free from detrimental habits and cultivate ones that lead to success.</p><h2 id=5-mans-search-for-meaning-by-viktor-e-frankl>5. <strong>Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning by Viktor E.
