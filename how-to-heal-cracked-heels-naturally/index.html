While they may seem like a mere cosmetic issue, cracked heels can cause discomfort and even lead to more serious foot conditions if left untreated. Fortunately, you don’t need to rely on expensive treatments or harsh chemicals to heal cracked heels.

Cracks usually form when the skin becomes dry and thickened, often due to factors such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Dry weather</strong>: Cold air can strip moisture from the skin, leaving it prone to cracking.</li><li><strong>Dehydration</strong>: Lack of proper hydration can contribute to dry skin.</li><li><strong>Prolonged standing</strong>: Long periods of standing or walking can put pressure on the feet, causing the skin to crack.</li><li><strong>Improper footwear</strong>: Shoes that do not provide enough support or protection can lead to cracked heels.</li><li><strong>Poor foot care habits</strong>: Failing to moisturize or exfoliate the feet regularly can cause dryness and cracks.</li></ul><p>Cracked heels can range from mild to severe. In mild cases, the cracks may only be superficial and may not cause any pain.
