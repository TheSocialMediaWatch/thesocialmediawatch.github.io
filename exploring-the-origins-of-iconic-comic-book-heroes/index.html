Instead, he relies on his intelligence, physical prowess, and an array of gadgets to fight crime. Created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, Batman first appeared in Detective Comics #27 in 1939.

His alter ego, Bruce Wayne, is a billionaire philanthropist who uses his resources to support his crime-fighting endeavors.

Peter, debuted in All Star Comics #8 in 1941. Princess Diana of Themyscira, also known as Wonder Woman, hails from the all-female Amazonian society. Gifted with superhuman strength, agility, and the power of flight, she fights for peace, love, and gender equality.</p><p>Wonder Woman&rsquo;s origin story is rooted in Greek mythology. She leaves her island paradise to venture into the world of men, becoming an ambassador for her people and a symbol of empowerment. With her iconic Lasso of Truth and indestructible bracelets, Wonder Woman has become a symbol of female strength and resilience.</p><h2 id=spider-man-your-friendly-neighborhood-hero>Spider-Man: Your Friendly Neighborhood Hero</h2><p>Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, Spider-Man swung onto the comic book scene in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962. Peter Parker, a high school student with a knack for science, gained his extraordinary abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider. With his newfound powers, including wall-crawling, superhuman strength, and a &ldquo;spider-sense&rdquo; that alerts him to danger, Spider-Man fights crime while grappling with the challenges of everyday life.</p><p>Spider-Man&rsquo;s relatable nature and witty banter have endeared him to fans of all ages.
