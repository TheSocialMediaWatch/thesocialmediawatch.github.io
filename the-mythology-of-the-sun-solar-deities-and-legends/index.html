Often depicted with a falcon head and a sun disk above, Ra was believed to travel across the sky in his solar boat, bringing light to the world. His journey was thought to be a daily battle against the forces of chaos, particularly the serpent Apophis, who represented darkness and disorder.</p><p>Ra was also associated with creation and kingship. Pharaohs were seen as his earthly representatives, and his worship was integral to the religious practices of ancient Egypt. Temples dedicated to Ra, such as the famous temple of Karnak, served as centers of worship and pilgrimage.</p><h3 id=helios-the-greek-sun-god>Helios: The Greek Sun God</h3><p>In Greek mythology, Helios personifies the sun. Described as a handsome god who drives the chariot of the sun across the sky, Helios was often depicted as a radiant figure, illuminating the world with his golden light. Unlike other deities, Helios was not a major figure in Greek religious practices but played an essential role in various myths.</p><p>One of the most famous stories involving Helios is that of Phaethon, his mortal son.
