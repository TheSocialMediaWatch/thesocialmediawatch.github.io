A Brief History of Romance and Cocktails
Did you know that the first cocktail was created in the 18th century by Antoine Peychaud, a New Orleans apothecary? Peychaud's creation, a medicinal elixir made with rye whiskey, Benedictine, and bitters, was served in an egg cup and became the precursor to the modern-day cocktail. The art of mixology has since evolved, with bartenders and chefs around the world experimenting with new flavors and techniques to create bespoke cocktails that tantalize the taste buds.
