Fortunately, there are plenty of delicious, nutritious options that can curb your cravings without derailing your diet. In this post, we&rsquo;ll explore some of the best low-calorie snacks that are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients to keep you energized and satisfied.</p><h2 id=1-veggies-and-hummus>1. Veggies and Hummus</h2><p>One of the most satisfying and healthy low-calorie snacks you can enjoy is a combination of fresh vegetables and hummus. Vegetables such as cucumber, bell peppers, celery, and carrots are not only low in calories but also high in fiber and water, which helps you feel full longer. Pairing them with hummus adds a dose of healthy fats and protein, making this snack both tasty and satisfying.</p><p>Hummus is made from chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, garlic, and lemon juice, providing a creamy texture that complements the crunch of fresh veggies. To keep the calorie count low, stick to a small portion of hummus, as it can be calorie-dense. However, even a modest amount is enough to add flavor and make your snack feel indulgent.</p><h3 id=why-its-great>Why It&rsquo;s Great:</h3><ul><li>Low in calories and high in fiber</li><li>Packed with vitamins and minerals</li><li>A good source of healthy fats and protein</li></ul><h2 id=2-greek-yogurt-with-berries>2.
