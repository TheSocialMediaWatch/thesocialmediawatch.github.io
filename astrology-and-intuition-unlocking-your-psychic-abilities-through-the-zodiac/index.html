These abilities are often associated with heightened intuition and the capacity to tap into energies beyond the physical realm.</p><h2 id=the-influence-of-astrology>The Influence of Astrology</h2><p>Astrology, the study of the positions and movements of celestial bodies, has long been used as a tool for understanding human behavior, personality traits, and life events. Each zodiac sign, determined by the position of the sun at the time of one&rsquo;s birth, is believed to influence an individual&rsquo;s character and destiny. However, astrology also offers valuable insights into our intuitive and psychic inclinations.</p><h2 id=zodiac-signs-and-psychic-abilities>Zodiac Signs and Psychic Abilities</h2><p>Every zodiac sign is associated with specific traits and inclinations, including intuitive and psychic abilities.
