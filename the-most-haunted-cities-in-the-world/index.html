With its ancient streets, historic buildings, and deep connection to Scottish history, it’s no wonder this city has earned its reputation as a paranormal hotspot.</p><p>The most notorious haunted location in Edinburgh is the <strong>Edinburgh Castle</strong>, which has been standing since the 12th century. Numerous reports of ghostly apparitions and strange sounds have come from both visitors and staff over the years.
