Not only do they offer a chance to influence the future of brands, but they also provide a rewarding income stream that fits around your schedule. This comprehensive guide explores everything you need to know about making money by participating in online focus groups.</p><hr><h2 id=understanding-online-focus-groups>Understanding Online Focus Groups</h2><p>Online focus groups are essentially research discussions conducted through platforms like Zoom, specialized survey websites, or interactive forums.
