Their guidelines impact how countries regulate cryptocurrencies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Local Regulatory Authorities</strong>: Many countries have their own regulatory agencies, which may introduce laws that specifically target cryptocurrency transactions and exchanges.</p></li></ul><h2 id=current-regulatory-trends>Current Regulatory Trends</h2><h3 id=1-increased-government-scrutiny>1.
