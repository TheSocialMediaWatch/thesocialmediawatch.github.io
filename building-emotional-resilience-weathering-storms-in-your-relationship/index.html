Here are some tips to enhance communication:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Practice Active Listening</strong>: Show genuine interest in what your partner is saying. Avoid interrupting and provide feedback to demonstrate understanding.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use &ldquo;I&rdquo; Statements</strong>: Focus on your feelings rather than assigning blame.

This can help shift your focus from problems to the positives in your relationship.</p></li><li><p><strong>Celebrate Small Wins</strong>: Acknowledge and celebrate achievements, no matter how small. This could be overcoming a disagreement or successfully navigating a stressful situation together.</p></li></ul><h3 id=6-seek-professional-help-if-needed>6.
