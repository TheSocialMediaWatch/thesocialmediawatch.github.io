Names like Tolkien, Martin, and Sanderson dominate the shelves and conversations, but the genre flourishes because of countless authors quietly weaving stories brimming with flair, imagination, and innovation. These titles may not have won the popularity contest, but they absolutely deserve a space on your reading list. Ready your to-be-read pile—let’s dive into ten underrated fantasy books that will ignite your imagination and maybe even become your new favorites.</p><hr><h2 id=1-the-forgotten-beasts-of-eld-by-patricia-a-mckillip>1. <strong>The Forgotten Beasts of Eld</strong> by Patricia A. McKillip</h2><p>Patricia A. McKillip crafts a tapestry of elegant prose and mythic ambiance in <em>The Forgotten Beasts of Eld</em>. Published in the 1970s but still surprisingly fresh, the novel revolves around Sybel, a solitary sorceress living atop Eld Mountain with a menagerie of legendary creatures. When the outside world intrudes in the form of a baby boy and a war-faring prince, Sybel must navigate power, love, vengeance, and her own formidable magic.</p><p>The book’s dreamlike style, emotional resonance, and refusal to follow predictable tropes make it an unsung classic. Magic in this story feels uncanny and organic, blending with themes of isolation, transformation, and self-determination. If you like lyrical storytelling and powerful female leads, this fantasy tale packs a punch far beyond its slim page count.</p><hr><h2 id=2-the-long-price-quartet-by-daniel-abraham>2. <strong>The Long Price Quartet</strong> by Daniel Abraham</h2><p>Many multi-book fantasy series sprawl for thousands of pages, but Daniel Abraham’s <em>The Long Price Quartet</em> masterfully condenses ambition, character depth, and worldbuilding into four tightly plotted volumes. Set in a world where poets literally shape reality by binding “andat”—conceptual spirits made flesh—the story follows Otah Machi and his entanglements with power, love, and societal decline across decades.</p><p>What sets this series apart is the intricate moral struggles, subtle political maneuvering, and its meditation on language as both weapon and wonder. Abraham’s gift is showing how a single choice can ripple over generations, leaving you with lingering questions about fate and forgiveness. Readers tired of cookie-cutter Chosen Ones will find delight in this deft, grown-up take on fantasy.</p><hr><h2 id=3-the-goblin-emperor-by-katherine-addison>3. <strong>The Goblin Emperor</strong> by Katherine Addison</h2><p>Want an antidote to grimdark worlds filled with endless violence? <em>The Goblin Emperor</em> provides hope and courtesy amid the backstabs. Maia, the half-goblin outcast, unexpectedly inherits the throne of an elven empire after a tragic airship explosion eliminates his relatives. Outclassed and isolated, he navigates treacherous court politics, determined to do right by himself and his people.</p><p>Katherine Addison’s court intrigue sparkles with clever dialogue, unique customs, and heartwarming growth. Instead of world-ending peril, the stakes here are personal—will Maia survive his own awkwardness and the relentless machinations around him? Fans of character-driven fantasy and court politics will get happily hooked by this refreshing, earnest tale.</p><hr><h2 id=4-tooth-and-claw-by-jo-walton>4. <strong>Tooth and Claw</strong> by Jo Walton</h2><p><em>A Victorian novel—with dragons instead of people.</em> That’s the irresistible elevator pitch for Jo Walton’s <em>Tooth and Claw</em>. Walton spins a witty, melodramatic story of inheritance, manners, and family feuds in a society where dragons battle both for territory and social standing. The narrative follows five dragon siblings after their father’s death, exposing schemes and secrets worthy of Jane Austen.</p><p>Beneath the genteel surface, Walton injects sharp satire and clever worldbuilding, making dragon customs strange yet strangely familiar. This fantasy novel seamlessly blends humor, bite, and emotional depth—perfect for readers who enjoy a genre mashup or want a clever twist on dragon lore.</p><hr><h2 id=5-tigana-by-guy-gavriel-kay>5. <strong>Tigana</strong> by Guy Gavriel Kay</h2><p>Guy Gavriel Kay has authored many epic fantasy novels, but <em>Tigana</em> stands apart as a profound meditation on memory, loss, and resistance. The land of Tigana has been magically stripped of its name as punishment, making it literally unremembered by outsiders. A small group of rebels risk everything to reclaim their country’s identity and restore what was stolen.</p><p>Kay’s evocative worldbuilding and emotionally charged narrative ensure the stakes feel intimate yet monumental. The poetic writing, layered characters, and thoughtful musings on history and erasure offer a rewarding read for anyone weary of formulaic fantasy. If you crave a tale with moral complexity and real heartbreak, <em>Tigana</em> will resonate deeply.</p><hr><h2 id=6-the-curse-of-chalion-by-lois-mcmaster-bujold>6. <strong>The Curse of Chalion</strong> by Lois McMaster Bujold</h2><p>You might know Bujold for her science fiction accolades, but her <em>World of the Five Gods</em> fantasy novels showcase the same deft character work and compelling plots. <em>The Curse of Chalion</em> introduces Cazaril, a war-weary noble who seeks nothing more than peace, but finds himself entwined in deadly court intrigues and divine machinations.</p><p>What makes this fantasy novel sing is the blend of rich worldbuilding, insightful exploration of trauma and redemption, and a magic system tied directly to the gods and fate. Bujold subverts expectations at every turn, creating a story where personal and political stakes are woven with elegant precision. It’s a masterclass in storytelling from start to finish.</p><hr><h2 id=7-the-summer-tree-by-guy-gavriel-kay>7. <strong>The Summer Tree</strong> by Guy Gavriel Kay</h2><p>It’s no coincidence that Kay appears twice—his novels are criminally underrated. <em>The Summer Tree</em>, first in the <em>Fionavar Tapestry</em> trilogy, takes familiar fantasy conventions and pushes them deeper. Five Canadian grad students are whisked away to Fionavar, a mythic world facing apocalypse, and discover destinies tied to both ancient prophecy and the raw pain of loss.</p><p>The book hits familiar beats—heroic quests, brooding gods, chosen mortals—but Kay’s lyrical writing and willingness to explore difficult themes set it apart. There’s tragedy, romance, and a mythic resonance reminiscent of early fantasy legends, yet personal struggles ground the tale in emotional authenticity. If you want a story that’s both epic and intimate, start here.</p><hr><h2 id=8-sorcerer-to-the-crown-by-zen-cho>8. <strong>Sorcerer to the Crown</strong> by Zen Cho</h2><p>What if England’s Regency era pulsed not just with balls and tea, but with wild, unpredictable magic? Zen Cho’s <em>Sorcerer to the Crown</em> blends historical detail, sharp social commentary, and capricious fae. Zacharias Wythe, England’s first Black Sorcerer Royal, faces as many enemies from polite society as he does from rogue magicians, and when he meets Prunella, a young woman with illegal magical talent, society’s foundations start to shake.</p><p>Fun, funny, and fiercely intelligent, this fantasy book breaks boundaries both in story and style. Expect snappy banter, biting satire, and a complex world where wit and wisdom are just as important as magical firepower. It’s a joy for readers who appreciate both fantasy and Austen-esque drama.</p><hr><h2 id=9-the-lions-of-al-rassan-by-guy-gavriel-kay>9. <strong>The Lions of Al-Rassan</strong> by Guy Gavriel Kay</h2><p>Yes, Kay again—but this book cannot be skipped when talking about hidden fantasy treasures. <em>The Lions of Al-Rassan</em> draws inspiration from medieval Spain, chronicling the dissolution of an empire divided by religion, ambition, and love. The intertwined lives of poet-soldier Rodrigo, brilliant doctor Jehane, and cunning assassin Ammar weave a tapestry of fate where no victory comes without heartbreak.</p><p>This standalone novel offers the perfect mix of historical intrigue, elevated prose, and characters so vivid you’ll ache when you turn the last page. Kay uses fantasy to peel back the layers of real-world history, exploring loyalty, forgiveness, and what it means to be caught between worlds. If you’re looking for fantasy that transcends genre, this sits atop the pinnacle.</p><hr><h2 id=10-the-bone-ships-by-rj-barker>10. <strong>The Bone Ships</strong> by RJ Barker</h2><p>Sailing away from knights and wizards, RJ Barker delivers a sea-faring fantasy saga in <em>The Bone Ships</em>. Ship crews wage war aboard colossal vessels made from the bones of extinct sea dragons. That peace shatters when one of the mythical beasts is spotted alive, launching a desperate, thrilling hunt.</p><p>Barker’s world is gritty and oceanic, filled with sharp-tongued sailors and high-stakes naval battles. The story follows Joron Twiner, disgraced son of a once-powerful captain, who must scrape together a ragtag crew to defy both enemies and his own insecurity. With its original setting and relentless pace, this book is a refreshing plunge into nautical fantasy. Sea monsters, pirates, and found family—what’s not to love?</p><hr><h1 id=why-these-underrated-fantasy-books-matter>Why These Underrated Fantasy Books Matter</h1><p>It’s tempting to read only the biggest names in fantasy, but the genre’s real richness lies in its variety. These underrated fantasy novels break molds, offer unexpected perspectives, and often linger in your mind long after the last page.

When the fantasy landscape feels crowded and familiar, these books show just how expansive and surprising the genre can be.</p><hr><h1 id=create-your-own-magical-reading-list>Create Your Own Magical Reading List</h1><p>Chasing what’s overlooked in fantasy isn’t just about being contrary—it’s about finding the stories that might speak to you most powerfully.
