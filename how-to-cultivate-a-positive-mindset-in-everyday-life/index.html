Limit Exposure to Negativity</h3><p>In today&rsquo;s digital age, it&rsquo;s easy to become overwhelmed by negative news and social media. Consider limiting your exposure to negative influences by curating your media consumption. Follow accounts that inspire and motivate you, and take breaks from social media when needed. This practice can help maintain a positive environment in your life.</p><h3 id=9-cultivate-a-sense-of-humor>9. Cultivate a Sense of Humor</h3><p>Laughter is a natural antidote to negativity. Cultivating a sense of humor can lighten your mood and help you navigate life&rsquo;s challenges with grace. Watch comedies, share jokes with friends, or engage in activities that make you laugh.
