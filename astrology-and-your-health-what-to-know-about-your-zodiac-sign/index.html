Ruled by Mars, the planet of action and vitality, Aries tends to have a strong, athletic build and an abundance of energy. However, this high energy can sometimes lead to burnout or accidents, particularly if Aries doesn&rsquo;t take the time to rest or balance their activities.</p><h3 id=health-focus-for-aries>Health Focus for Aries:</h3><ul><li><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> Aries individuals benefit from regular exercise, particularly high-energy activities like running, cycling, or martial arts. However, they should be cautious of overexertion, as their enthusiasm may lead them to push their bodies too hard.</li><li><strong>Stress Management:</strong> Due to their active and sometimes impulsive nature, stress can build up quickly for Aries. Meditation, yoga, or activities that allow them to relax are crucial to maintaining emotional balance.</li><li><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Aries may experience head-related ailments like headaches or migraines, as well as injuries related to their physical activities. They should take extra care to avoid rushing into situations without proper safety precautions.</li></ul><h2 id=taurus-april-20---may-20>Taurus (April 20 - May 20)</h2><p>Taurus is an earth sign ruled by Venus, the planet of love and beauty. Known for their grounded and practical nature, Taureans tend to have a strong, resilient constitution. They are often associated with a love of good food, comfort, and relaxation.

Opting for whole foods and incorporating more vegetables, lean proteins, and fruits can help them stay healthy.</li><li><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> While not naturally inclined toward intense exercise, Taurus can benefit from activities that connect them with the earth, such as hiking, gardening, or yoga. These activities help them stay active without overwhelming them.</li><li><strong>Vulnerabilities:</strong> Taurus may struggle with issues related to the throat, neck, or thyroid, making regular check-ups important. They should also be mindful of their tendency to overindulge, which can lead to weight-related health problems.</li></ul><h2 id=gemini-may-21---june-20>Gemini (May 21 - June 20)</h2><p>Gemini, ruled by Mercury, is an air sign known for its quick-witted, adaptable, and communicative nature.
