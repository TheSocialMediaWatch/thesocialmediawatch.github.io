Whether you&rsquo;re a skeptic or a believer, there’s something unsettling about seeing an otherworldly event unfold in front of your eyes—especially when it’s recorded for everyone to see. Over the years, numerous videos have surfaced, showing things that can’t be easily explained by science or logic. Here are 10 creepy paranormal events that have been caught on camera, leaving us questioning what’s real and what isn’t.</p><h2 id=1-the-shadow-figure-in-the-haunted-house>1. The Shadow Figure in the Haunted House</h2><p>In 2013, a family in the United States installed security cameras after experiencing strange noises and objects moving on their own inside their home. Little did they know, they were about to capture something that would send chills down the spine of anyone who watched it. The footage shows a shadowy figure darting across a room at high speed, vanishing almost as quickly as it appeared.</p><p>This particular event was shared widely on the internet, with viewers divided over its authenticity. Some claimed it was an elaborate hoax, while others believed it was a genuine manifestation of a haunting. Paranormal experts examined the footage and couldn’t rule out the possibility of something supernatural at play. Whether it&rsquo;s a shadow person, a ghostly apparition, or an elaborate prank, this unsettling video continues to leave viewers on edge.</p><h2 id=2-the-ghostly-figure-in-a-surveillance-camera>2. The Ghostly Figure in a Surveillance Camera</h2><p>One of the most famous paranormal videos comes from a hospital security camera. In 2008, the camera captured a strange and unexplainable figure walking down a hospital hallway late at night. The figure, which appeared to be a woman in white, simply walks across the hallway before vanishing into thin air.</p><p>The creepy part? The hospital was empty at the time, with no staff or patients around. After the footage was shared online, some speculated that the woman in white was the spirit of a former patient who had died in that very hospital. Experts have suggested that the movement could have been caused by an electrical malfunction, but many who watched the video couldn’t shake the feeling that they were seeing something otherworldly.</p><h2 id=3-the-ghost-of-the-bell-witch>3. The Ghost of the Bell Witch</h2><p>The Bell Witch legend has been around for centuries, with reports of strange paranormal activity coming from the Bell family’s property in Tennessee. In recent years, a video surfaced that allegedly shows the ghostly presence of the Bell Witch herself. The footage was captured by a group of paranormal investigators exploring the Bell Witch Cave.</p><p>The video shows an orb of light that seems to move in a controlled manner, followed by a mysterious figure that materializes in the shadows. Some claim it’s just a trick of the light, while others believe it’s proof of the supernatural presence that’s haunted the area for generations. The Bell Witch remains one of the most famous paranormal legends in America, and this video only adds to the eerie mystery surrounding the case.</p><h2 id=4-the-haunted-doll-movement>4. The Haunted Doll Movement</h2><p>Dolls have long been associated with creepy legends, and for good reason. In 2015, a viral video showed a doll moving on its own, seemingly shifting positions in response to its environment. The doll, which was sitting on a shelf, appeared to turn its head to face the camera before slowly turning its body around as if responding to an unseen force.</p><p>The video quickly gained attention, and experts were divided over the cause. Some believed it was a clever trick or string manipulation, while others were convinced the doll was possessed by some kind of spirit. Regardless of the explanation, the unsettling footage remains one of the most talked-about paranormal events captured on camera.</p><h2 id=5-the-ghost-car-of-new-jersey>5. The Ghost Car of New Jersey</h2><p>In 2014, a viral video appeared showing what seemed to be a ghostly car appearing out of nowhere. The footage, which was captured by a dashcam, shows a car seemingly materializing out of thin air on a New Jersey highway. The car is seen briefly before it fades away, leaving nothing but empty road behind it.</p><p>Though the video could be a product of digital manipulation, many have pointed out that the sudden and unexplained appearance of the car fits into a common paranormal phenomenon known as &ldquo;ghost vehicles.&rdquo; These ghostly apparitions are often associated with accidents or tragic events on the road, and this particular video left many wondering if the ghost car was a manifestation of something that happened long ago.</p><h2 id=6-the-poltergeist-activity-in-the-abandoned-hospital>6. The Poltergeist Activity in the Abandoned Hospital</h2><p>In 2016, a group of paranormal investigators captured some spine-chilling footage inside an abandoned hospital in the UK. The video shows various objects moving on their own in what appears to be a classic case of poltergeist activity. Chairs are seen moving across the floor, and objects are thrown around the room with no visible cause.</p><p>The footage gained widespread attention, with many viewers expressing their shock and disbelief at the sheer intensity of the paranormal events. Some experts believe that poltergeist activity is caused by the subconscious energy of individuals, but no one could explain the violent movements and the eerie feeling that pervaded the space during the recording.</p><h2 id=7-the-creepy-girl-in-the-mirror>7. The Creepy Girl in the Mirror</h2><p>In 2017, a family in Japan shared footage from their home security system, showing something truly terrifying. The video shows a young girl standing in front of a mirror, but when she turns to face the camera, her reflection remains staring forward, as if it hasn’t moved. The girl then steps away from the mirror, but her reflection lingers for a few moments before vanishing.</p><p>This disturbing footage caused an uproar on social media, with many viewers wondering if the reflection was a ghostly entity, a technical glitch, or something more sinister. The unsettling nature of the event left many feeling deeply uncomfortable, and the video quickly became one of the most infamous paranormal clips online.</p><h2 id=8-the-disappearing-woman-in-the-cemetery>8. The Disappearing Woman in the Cemetery</h2><p>Cemeteries have long been associated with eerie legends, and in 2018, a video surfaced from a cemetery in the UK that added to these chilling stories. The footage shows a woman in white walking through the cemetery at night. However, as the camera zooms in, the woman appears to vanish into thin air.</p><p>Several theories were proposed about the disappearance. Some argued that it was an optical illusion or a trick of the light, but others were convinced that the woman in white was a spirit. The cemetery, which had a long history of paranormal activity, is rumored to be haunted by the spirits of those buried there, and this video only reinforced that belief.</p><h2 id=9-the-screaming-woman-on-the-bridge>9. The Screaming Woman on the Bridge</h2><p>In 2019, a camera installed on a bridge in the US captured a disturbing event that would leave anyone who watched it with a sense of dread. The footage shows a figure standing near the edge of the bridge, and as the camera zooms in, a blood-curdling scream can be heard. The figure appears to be a woman, but her face is obscured, and she vanishes just as quickly as she appeared.</p><p>The scream, which is chillingly real, has led many viewers to believe that the woman was a spirit trapped on the bridge, possibly due to a tragic death. Despite efforts to explain the phenomenon as a trick of the wind or a prank, the eerie nature of the video has left many questioning its true origin.</p><h2 id=10-the-apparition-in-the-old-asylum>10. The Apparition in the Old Asylum</h2><p>In 2020, a group of paranormal investigators were exploring an old asylum when they captured something truly terrifying on camera. As they walked down the dark, desolate halls, one of the investigators pointed out a strange figure in the distance. The figure was translucent, almost ghostly, and appeared to be moving toward them.</p><p>As they approached the figure, it suddenly disappeared, leaving only the empty hallway behind. The investigators were shaken by what they had witnessed, and many viewers of the video were equally disturbed. Some suggested that the figure was a manifestation of one of the many souls that had once inhabited the asylum, which was notorious for its mistreatment of patients.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Whether you believe in the supernatural or not, the footage of these paranormal events captured on camera is enough to make anyone question the unknown. While some videos can easily be dismissed as hoaxes or tricks, others remain genuinely unsettling, sparking debates about the existence of ghosts, spirits, and other entities that lie beyond our understanding.</p><p>These 10 creepy paranormal events caught on camera serve as a reminder that there are still mysteries in the world that science and logic can’t always explain. The next time you’re alone in the dark or walking down an empty hallway, you might want to double-check your surroundings—you never know what might be watching you from the shadows.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://various.googlexy.com/categories/paranormal/>Paranormal</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=next href=https://various.googlexy.com/10-creepy-urban-legends-with-paranormal-origins/><span class=title>Next »</span><br><span>10 Creepy Urban Legends with Paranormal Origins</span></a></nav><nav class=paginav><ul style=list-style-type:none><li><small>See Also</small></li><li><ul style=list-style-type:none><li><small><a href=/the-curse-of-the-bermuda-triangle/>The Curse of the Bermuda Triangle</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/haunted-battlefields-ghostly-remnants-of-war/>Haunted Battlefields: Ghostly Remnants of War</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/the-mystery-of-black-eyed-children-paranormal-entities-or-urban-legend/>The Mystery of Black-Eyed Children: Paranormal Entities or Urban Legend?</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/what-are-the-causes-of-poltergeist-activity/>What Are the Causes of Poltergeist Activity?</a></small></li><li><small><a href=/haunted-dolls-the-sinister-side-of-childhood-toys/>Haunted Dolls: The Sinister Side of Childhood Toys</a></small></li></ul></li></ul></nav></footer></article></main><footer class=footer><span>&copy; 2025 <a href=https://various.googlexy.com/>All the knowledge is here!</a></span></footer><a href=#top aria-label="go to top" title="Go to Top (Alt + G)" class=top-link id=top-link accesskey=g><svg viewBox="0 0 12 6" fill="currentcolor"><path d="M12 6H0l6-6z"/></svg>
