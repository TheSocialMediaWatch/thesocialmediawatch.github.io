However, they can scratch easily and may not be suitable for high-heat cooking.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cast Iron</strong>: Known for its excellent heat retention and even cooking, cast iron cookware can go from stovetop to oven. It requires seasoning and maintenance to prevent rust but can last a lifetime with proper care.</p></li><li><p><strong>Copper</strong>: Known for its superior heat conductivity, copper cookware allows for precise temperature control.
