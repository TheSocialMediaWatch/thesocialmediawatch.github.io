Created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster in 1938, Superman embodies the archetype of the superhero. His origin story begins on the dying planet of Krypton, where he was born as Kal-El.

His speed enables him to react instantly, and he can fly faster than the speed of light. Additionally, Superman&rsquo;s heat vision can melt steel, and his freeze breath can create ice structures or freeze enemies. His only weaknesses are Kryptonite and magic, making him a nearly unstoppable force.</p><h3 id=iconic-moments>Iconic Moments</h3><p>Superman has had countless iconic moments throughout his history, but one that stands out is his battle with Doomsday in &ldquo;The Death of Superman&rdquo; storyline.
