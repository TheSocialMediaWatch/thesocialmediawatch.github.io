His only weaknesses are Kryptonite and magic, making him a nearly unstoppable force.</p><h3 id=iconic-moments>Iconic Moments</h3><p>Superman has had countless iconic moments throughout his history, but one that stands out is his battle with Doomsday in &ldquo;The Death of Superman&rdquo; storyline.
