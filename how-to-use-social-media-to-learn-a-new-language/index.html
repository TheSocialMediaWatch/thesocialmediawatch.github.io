With traditional methods like textbooks, grammar exercises, and language apps, it often feels like you&rsquo;re stuck in a repetitive cycle. However, social media offers a unique, dynamic, and engaging way to immerse yourself in the language you want to learn. It provides an opportunity to learn through real-life conversations, exposure to native speakers, and interactive content that can keep you motivated.
