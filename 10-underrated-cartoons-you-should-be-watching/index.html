However, a treasure trove of underrated cartoons often goes unnoticed, offering unique storytelling, stunning animation, and unforgettable characters. These hidden gems deserve a spot on your watchlist. Let’s dive into ten underrated cartoons that showcase creativity and depth, proving that animation can be just as compelling for adults as it is for children.</p><h2 id=1-the-owl-house>1. <strong>The Owl House</strong></h2><p><em>The Owl House</em>, created by Dana Terrace, has quickly gained a cult following thanks to its enchanting storytelling and diverse representation. This Disney Channel series follows Luz, a self-assured teenage girl who stumbles upon a magical realm. Here, she becomes the apprentice to a rebellious witch named Eda. The show blends humor, adventure, and heartwarming moments while tackling themes of identity and acceptance. Its rich world-building and complex characters make it a standout that deserves more recognition.</p><h2 id=2-infinity-train>2. <strong>Infinity Train</strong></h2><p><em>Infinity Train</em> is an anthology series that explores deep themes within a fantastical setting. Each season follows a different protagonist as they navigate a mysterious train filled with bizarre cars, each holding unique worlds and challenges. The show&rsquo;s narrative structure allows for profound character development, and its exploration of grief, self-discovery, and personal growth resonates with viewers of all ages. Despite its critical acclaim, it remains underappreciated, making it a must-watch for fans of thought-provoking animation.</p><h2 id=3-hilda>3. <strong>Hilda</strong></h2><p>Based on the graphic novels by Luke Pearson, <em>Hilda</em> is a Netflix original series that beautifully combines whimsy and adventure. The story follows a fearless blue-haired girl as she navigates a world filled with magical creatures and breathtaking landscapes. Hilda’s curiosity and bravery are infectious, making the show a delight to watch. Its stunning animation style and engaging narratives about friendship, bravery, and exploration are bound to capture the hearts of viewers, yet it often flies under the radar.</p><h2 id=4-ducktales-2017>4. <strong>DuckTales (2017)</strong></h2><p>While the original <em>DuckTales</em> from the late &rsquo;80s is a beloved classic, the 2017 reboot brought fresh energy and modern storytelling to the franchise. This series reintroduces Scrooge McDuck and his grandnephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie, embarking on new adventures filled with humor and intrigue. The show enhances character development, explores deeper emotional themes, and includes a diverse cast. Despite its quality, it hasn&rsquo;t received the attention it deserves, making it a fantastic watch for both new fans and those nostalgic for the original.</p><h2 id=5-tuca--bertie>5. <strong>Tuca & Bertie</strong></h2><p>For those seeking a more adult-oriented animated series, <em>Tuca & Bertie</em> is a hidden gem. This Netflix series, created by Lisa Hanawalt (known for her work on <em>BoJack Horseman</em>), follows the lives of two anthropomorphic bird women navigating the challenges of adulthood. Its vibrant animation style, coupled with humor and poignant moments, addresses mental health, friendship, and personal growth. The show’s unique perspective and relatable themes make it an underrated treasure that resonates with many adults.</p><h2 id=6-kipo-and-the-age-of-the-wonderbeasts>6. <strong>Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts</strong></h2><p><em>Kipo and the Age of the Wonderbeasts</em> is a post-apocalyptic adventure that follows Kipo, a young girl who must navigate a world overrun by mutated animals. The vibrant animation and catchy soundtrack complement the series&rsquo; themes of friendship, courage, and self-acceptance. Each episode introduces viewers to imaginative creatures and unique challenges, making it a visually stunning and emotionally engaging experience. Despite its captivating storytelling, the show remains lesser-known and is deserving of a larger audience.</p><h2 id=7-the-amazing-world-of-gumball>7. <strong>The Amazing World of Gumball</strong></h2><p>While <em>The Amazing World of Gumball</em> has garnered some attention, it often doesn’t receive the acclaim it deserves. This Cartoon Network series blends various animation styles to tell the story of Gumball Watterson and his family living in the fictional town of Elmore. The humor is clever and often surreal, appealing to both children and adults. Its satirical take on everyday life, combined with a diverse cast of characters, makes it both entertaining and thought-provoking, solidifying its place as a must-see series.</p><h2 id=8-over-the-garden-wall>8. <strong>Over the Garden Wall</strong></h2><p><em>Over the Garden Wall</em> is a beautifully crafted miniseries that follows two half-brothers as they journey through a mysterious forest. The show masterfully combines elements of fantasy and folklore, creating a hauntingly charming atmosphere. Its short run time makes it an accessible watch, and the storytelling is rich with emotional depth and whimsical humor. While it has received some accolades, its unique style and poignant messages make it an underrated classic that should not be missed.</p><h2 id=9-big-mouth>9. <strong>Big Mouth</strong></h2><p><em>Big Mouth</em> is an animated coming-of-age series that delves into the awkwardness of adolescence with humor and honesty. Created by Nick Kroll and Andrew Goldberg, the show follows a group of middle schoolers as they navigate the complexities of puberty. The candid discussions about sexuality, friendship, and self-discovery are both hilarious and relatable. While it may not be for everyone due to its explicit content, its raw portrayal of growing up deserves recognition for its authenticity and humor.</p><h2 id=10-the-dragon-prince>10. <strong>The Dragon Prince</strong></h2><p>From the creators of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, <em>The Dragon Prince</em> is a fantasy series that combines magic, adventure, and political intrigue. The story follows two human princes and an elven assassin who team up to bring peace to their warring kingdoms. The animation is stunning, and the storytelling is rich with lore and character development. Despite its high-quality production and engaging plot, it remains underrated, making it a must-watch for fans of epic fantasy animation.</p><hr><h3 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h3><p>In a world filled with countless animated series, these ten underrated cartoons offer a refreshing perspective that often gets overshadowed by more mainstream options. Each show brings its unique blend of storytelling, humor, and emotional depth, appealing to a wide range of viewers.
