Resilient individuals are also more likely to take on leadership roles, as they can inspire and support their colleagues during challenging times. Moreover, building a resilient workforce can lead to increased productivity, improved morale, and reduced turnover, ultimately benefiting the organization as a whole.</p><h2 id=strategies-for-building-resilience>Strategies for Building Resilience</h2><h3 id=1-cultivate-a-growth-mindset>1.
