James Clear’s <em>Atomic Habits</em> masterfully explains how tiny tweaks to daily routines can yield monumental results. Unlike grand gestures that can fizzle out, Clear’s approach encourages progress through modest behavioral changes, made both approachable and sustainable.</p><p>The book’s strength lies in its clarity and actionable strategies for shaping better habits while shedding destructive ones.
