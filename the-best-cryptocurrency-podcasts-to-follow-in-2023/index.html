The world of cryptocurrency moves fast—sometimes at hyperloop speed. Whether you’re a blockchain junkie, a curious investor, or someone just trying to follow the latest FTX drama, podcasts offer something that Twitter threads and YouTube explainers rarely can: deep, unhurried conversations, expert analysis, and a sense of connectedness to the pulse of the crypto world. But with new shows popping up all the time—some insightful, some hype-driven, some little more than pump-and-dump infomercials—how do you know which are really worth your attention?</p><p>Here’s a rundown of the best cryptocurrency podcasts to follow in 2023, covering everything from technical analysis and policy discussions, to the wildest stories coming out of DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. Dive in and curate your go-to feed.</p><hr><h2 id=1-bankless>1. <strong>Bankless</strong></h2><p>Bankless is more than just a podcast; it’s become a substantial movement and educational hub in the decentralized finance space. Hosted by Ryan Sean Adams and David Hoffman, each episode ventures into the technical, philosophical, and practical aspects of becoming “bankless”—i.e., opting out of traditional finance in favor of blockchain-based systems.</p><p><strong>What keeps it engaging</strong>: A regular mix of expert interviews, breakdowns of major protocol upgrades (think Ethereum merges and Layer 2 scaling), and lively banter. The hosts are skilled at leveling complex ideas for both crypto natives and curious newcomers. Bankless is also one of the few podcasts that never backs away from hard questions, especially in the aftermath of high-profile failures or hacks.</p><p><strong>Standout episodes in 2023</strong>: Expect incisive takes on regulatory shifts, roll-ups, L2 ecosystems, and Ethereum’s development roadmap. If you’re serious about navigating the decentralized economy, subscribe and prepare for deep learning.</p><hr><h2 id=2-unchained--unconfirmed>2. <strong>Unchained / Unconfirmed</strong></h2><p>Laura Shin’s flagship podcast, Unchained, remains a weekly “must-listen” for anyone charting the intricacies of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and fintech news. With a journalist’s knack for probing the heart of every story, Shin brings transparency and clarity to topics that often get muddled with jargon or overhyped headlines.</p><p><strong>Why it’s essential</strong>: The conversations oscillate between big-picture regulatory talk (think SEC lawsuits, international frameworks) and on-the-ground innovations—grant programs, new blockchains, influential creators. Her companion show, Unconfirmed, delivers rapid-fire insights and timely analysis, perfect for those needing a weekly pulse check on breaking developments.</p><p><strong>2023 highlights</strong>: Look for interviews with industry leaders following turbulent cycles, deep-dives into new consensus mechanisms, and practical advice for surviving bear markets.</p><hr><h2 id=3-the-pomp-podcast>3. <strong>The Pomp Podcast</strong></h2><p>Anthony “Pomp” Pompliano stands out for his bombastic, unapologetically bullish approach to all things Bitcoin (and, increasingly, broader Web3 topics). The Pomp Podcast features high-profile guests from every corner of fintech: investors, Lightning Network developers, AI enthusiasts, and even skeptical economists.</p><p><strong>Unique value</strong>: Expect a blend of investment advice, macro analysis, and hard-hitting questions about scalability, adoption, and the future of money. Pomp’s signature style—part motivational, part analytical—makes even the densest subjects accessible, and every episode feels like both a briefing and a pep talk.</p><p><strong>Top 2023 episodes</strong>: Watch for updates on institutional Bitcoin adoption, lightning-fast developments in Layer 2 solutions, and big-picture financial trends that intersect with digital assets.</p><hr><h2 id=4-crypto-critics-corner>4. <strong>Crypto Critics’ Corner</strong></h2><p>If you want a skeptical take—or just need a break from maximalist hype—Crypto Critics’ Corner, hosted by Cas Piancey and Bennett Tomlin, is the antidote to your Twitter echo chamber. This podcast picks apart industry narratives, exposes scams, and bravely dissects why things sometimes go terribly wrong in crypto.</p><p><strong>What works</strong>: Each episode balances technical critique and skepticism with humor and humility. Whether the topic is failed stablecoins, rug pulls, or questionable DeFi protocols, the hosts explain complicated failures without ever losing empathy for users caught in the crossfire. Essential listening if you’re tired of “numba go up” talk.</p><p><strong>Notable episodes in 2023</strong>: Detailed post-mortems of major collapses, breakdowns of new regulatory actions, and practical advice on due diligence.</p><hr><h2 id=5-the-defiant>5. <strong>The Defiant</strong></h2><p>Helmed by former Bloomberg journalist Camila Russo, The Defiant focuses on DeFi—arguably the most frenetic, wild-west segment of today’s crypto world. If you’re interested in yield farming, novel governance models, and how DeFi is shaking traditional finance to its core, this is your stop.</p><p><strong>Content approach</strong>: The Defiant blends news, interviews, and technical explainers with just enough skepticism. You’ll learn directly from DeFi founders, coders, and investors, with actionable intelligence for appraising new tokens and projects. It’s especially good at tracking trends before they become Twitter memes.</p><p><strong>2023 content to watch</strong>: Spotlights on innovative Layer 2 chains, discussions of cross-chain interoperability, and real talk on security risks.</p><hr><h2 id=6-on-the-brink-with-castle-island>6. <strong>On the Brink with Castle Island</strong></h2><p>Somewhere between policy wonk and venture capital lounge lies On the Brink with Castle Island Ventures’ Nic Carter and Matt Walsh. This podcast stands out by dissecting regulatory news, legislative proposals, and investment theses with clarity and depth.</p><p><strong>What’s smart</strong>: Rather than parroting talking points, Carter and Walsh dig into the gray areas: privacy laws, central bank digital currency proposals, and macroeconomic impacts of crypto assets. Guest lineups often include lawyers, policy makers, and technologists, so you’ll come away smarter each week.</p><p><strong>Highlights for 2023</strong>: Analysis of new SEC regulations, the possible rise and fall of CBDCs, and cross-chain security challenges.</p><hr><h2 id=7-what-bitcoin-did>7. <strong>What Bitcoin Did</strong></h2><p>Peter McCormack’s What Bitcoin Did is the go-to podcast for anyone seeking to explore the entire Bitcoin ecosystem, from “block height zero” to current controversies over miner incentives. With a rotating roster of guests—developers, educators, maximalists and skeptics alike—McCormack keeps conversations candid and relatable.</p><p><strong>Strengths</strong>: This show goes beyond just price action and technical nitty-gritty. It’s a window into Bitcoin’s evolving identity, from digital gold narrative to “freedom money.” Special mention to episodes explaining legal and ethical debates, privacy, and the Lightning Network.</p><p><strong>Don’t miss in 2023</strong>: Emerging themes like Bitcoin’s role in emerging markets, updates from taproot, and interviews with critics and reformers alike.</p><hr><h2 id=8-the-delphi-podcast>8. <strong>The Delphi Podcast</strong></h2><p>Running the gauntlet from serious research to fireside chat, The Delphi Podcast by Delphi Digital is perfect for listeners who want both depth and variety. It covers everything: from NFT market trends, protocol upgrades, tokenomics, and predictions for next-gen blockchain games.</p><p><strong>Why tune in</strong>: Consistently sharp interviews with thought leaders, founders, and analysts. The team’s research-first approach gives episodes substance that outlasts the news cycle, making it especially relevant for serious investors.</p><p><strong>Hot in 2023</strong>: The future of DAOs, GameFi, and debates over decentralized identities. Expect tightly-packed data and forecasts.</p><hr><h2 id=9-tales-from-the-crypt--rabbit-hole-recap>9. <strong>Tales from the Crypt / Rabbit Hole Recap</strong></h2><p>Marty Bent became known for his no-nonsense, often irreverent approach to Bitcoin and energy policy—particularly how mining interacts with the real world. In Tales from the Crypt, conversations roam from deep technical topics (hash power, privacy, layer 2s) to no-holds-barred critiques of altcoins and regulatory overreach.</p><p><strong>Why fans love it</strong>: The banter between Bent and frequent co-host Matt Odell makes every episode fun, even when things get technical. Rabbit Hole Recap, the show’s news-focused spin-off, is weekly required listening for signal through noise.</p><p><strong>2023 essentials</strong>: Expect strong opinions about self-custody, the geopolitics of mining, and government encroachment.</p><hr><h2 id=10-epicenter>10. <strong>Epicenter</strong></h2><p>If you appreciate long-form, intellectual conversation that spans the crypto universe, Epicenter should be in your playlist. Hosted by a rotating crew of smart, open-minded interviewers, every episode tackles protocol development, enterprise blockchain, decentralized applications, and the philosophical underpinnings of Web3.</p><p><strong>Why it stands out</strong>: Depth, diversity, and consistency. Epicenter’s guests range from technical contributors on bleeding-edge projects to economic theorists and digital artists. This is the home of nuanced, developer-oriented talk.</p><p><strong>What’s new in 2023</strong>: Discussions around identity, digital ownership, modular blockchain architecture, and Ethereum’s continued evolution.</p><hr><h2 id=11-zero-knowledge>11. <strong>Zero Knowledge</strong></h2><p>Tech-minded listeners will find Zero Knowledge indispensable. Anna Rose interviews cryptographers, privacy researchers, protocol designers, and security experts, drawing out complex advancements in cryptography, scaling, ZK-SNARKs/STARKs, and privacy tech.</p><p><strong>USP</strong>: Zero Knowledge doesn’t assume you’re a computer science PhD, but it doesn’t dumb things down, either. If you’re interested in privacy, security, or the next generation of decentralized apps, subscribe for genuinely cutting-edge conversation.</p><p><strong>Top picks from 2023</strong>: Intros to zkEVMs, practical guides to building privacy apps, and trade-offs in blockchain scalability.</p><hr><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-right-podcast>How to Choose the Right Podcast</h2><p>With so many shows orbiting the crypto space, picking the right mix depends on your interests, background, and how much time you want to invest weekly. Some tips to curate your own crypto playlist:</p><ul><li><strong>Identify your learning style</strong>: Prefer formal interviews (Epicenter, Unchained), or banter-driven analyses (Rabbit Hole Recap, Crypto Critics’ Corner)?</li><li><strong>Prioritize your focus</strong>: Dedicated to one ecosystem (What Bitcoin Did), or want DeFi/NFT diversity (The Defiant, Delphi Podcast)?</li><li><strong>Time commitment</strong>: Some podcasts drop monster 2+ hour episodes. Others keep it to manageable half-hours.</li><li><strong>Credential check</strong>: Sample a few episodes to see if the hosts’ values and expertise align with yours. Some come off slick; others, more grassroots.</li><li><strong>Guest variety</strong>: The best shows bring new voices, not just the same circuit of “influencers.”</li></ul><hr><h2 id=keeping-up-without-overload>Keeping Up Without Overload</h2><p>Crypto never sleeps, and the deluge of information can be overwhelming. Here’s how to absorb insights efficiently:</p><ul><li><strong>Use smart playlists</strong>: Most podcast apps allow you to queue, bookmark, and speed up episodes.</li><li><strong>Follow show Twitter accounts</strong>: Get coverage highlights or clip-sized takeaways when you can’t listen to full episodes.</li><li><strong>Check show transcripts</strong>: Some podcasts (Unchained, Bankless, and The Defiant) publish transcripts for fast skimming.</li><li><strong>Sync with your reading</strong>: Pair podcast recommendations with in-depth newsletters for context—many hosts have affiliated Substacks or newsletters.</li><li><strong>Be mindful of bias</strong>: Remember, some podcasts skew maximalist or shill-heavy. Mix sources to get balanced viewpoints.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=trends-shaping-crypto-podcasting-in-2023>Trends Shaping Crypto Podcasting in 2023</h2><p>As the space matures (and mainstream interest ebbs and flows), several trends are shifting how podcasts serve their audiences:</p><ul><li><strong>More focus on regulation and compliance</strong>: With global regulatory crackdowns and shifting policies, expect meatier discussions about KYC, AML, on/off-ramps, and institutional adoption.</li><li><strong>Layer 2 and modular blockchains</strong>: As networks like Optimism, Arbitrum, and Polygon grow, technical deep-dives are getting more granular.</li><li><strong>NFT and gaming crossovers</strong>: Some shows are pivoting towards creators, digital artists, and GameFi entrepreneurs, reflecting the growing creator economy.</li><li><strong>Greater skepticism and accountability</strong>: After scandals rocked 2022, expect more episodes exposing frauds, hacks, and ethically gray zones.</li><li><strong>User-first content</strong>: From security how-tos to wallet setup walkthroughs, more podcasts are catering to non-technical users exploring crypto for the first time.</li></ul><hr><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>If 2022 was the year of crypto’s “great reckoning”—with exchange failures, regulatory drama, and wild NFT bear swings—2023 is shaping up as the year of rebuilding, reflection, and innovation. The best cryptocurrency podcasts don’t just track the price or echo the loudest voices; they provide space for debate, learning, and sometimes, hard questions when the community needs to hear them most.</p><p>Whether you’re looking for a daily market update, a technical masterclass, or simply smart company during your commute, the podcasts above offer a direct line into crypto’s heart and mind. Subscribe to a few, sample around, and you’ll soon build the perfect listening diet for whatever this wild industry throws at us next.</p><p>Let your inbox fill with fresh ideas—and perhaps, the occasional cautionary tale.</p><hr><p><em>Listening suggestion</em>: Browse episode titles before diving in. The best insights often come from surprise guests or explorations into topics you wouldn’t have picked on your own. In crypto, curiosity is not just rewarded—it’s essential for thriving.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://various.googlexy.com/categories/cryptocurrency/>Cryptocurrency</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://various.googlexy.com/the-best-cryptocurrency-news-websites-to-follow/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Best Cryptocurrency News Websites to Follow</span>
