Sometimes combining internet with phone, cloud storage, or security can save money and simplify vendor management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Test the Service when Possible</strong>
Some ISPs offer trial periods or temporary installations to evaluate connectivity and reliability before commitment.</p></li></ol><hr><h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>In 2025, small businesses have an abundance of internet service provider choices, each bringing different strengths to the table.
