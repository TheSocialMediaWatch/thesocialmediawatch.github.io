Before signing on the dotted line, it’s crucial to ask the right questions to ensure your purchase aligns with your lifestyle, financial goals, and long-term plans. This comprehensive guide walks you through the essential questions to ask before buying a condo, helping you make an informed and confident decision.</p><hr><h2 id=1-what-are-the-condo-association-fees-and-what-do-they-cover>1.
