Durga is depicted as a fierce warrior goddess, often shown riding a lion and wielding weapons in her multiple arms.</p><p>According to mythology, Durga was created by the gods to defeat the powerful demon Mahishasura, who had wreaked havoc on Earth.

Composed by the sage Valmiki, the Ramayana is a tale of love, loyalty, and the triumph of good over evil. It consists of seven books, known as Kandas, and is written in Sanskrit.</p><p>The epic begins with the birth and early life of Rama, his marriage to Sita, and their subsequent exile to the forest. The central part of the Ramayana focuses on Rama&rsquo;s quest to rescue Sita from the clutches of Ravana, the demon king of Lanka. With the help of an army of monkeys, Rama wages a fierce battle against Ravana&rsquo;s forces, ultimately triumphing and rescuing his beloved wife.</p><p>The Ramayana is not just a story of heroism and adventure but also a treasure trove of moral and ethical teachings.

The epic has been widely read, recited, and performed in various forms of art and literature across different cultures.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>The mythology of ancient India is a tapestry of fascinating stories that captivate the imagination and impart timeless wisdom.
