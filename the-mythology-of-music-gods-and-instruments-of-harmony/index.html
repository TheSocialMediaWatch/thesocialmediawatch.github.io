It was believed that by playing or listening to music, one could tap into the realms of the gods, experience profound emotions, and even alter the course of events.</p><p>Music had the ability to heal the wounded, calm raging seas, and even charm fierce beasts. It was a language that surpassed words, enabling communication on a deeper, more spiritual level.
