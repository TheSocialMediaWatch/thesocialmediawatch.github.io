Regularly reviewing your spending habits can help you identify areas where you can cut back. Here’s how you can effectively monitor your transactions through online banking:</p><ol><li><strong>Review Your Transaction History</strong>: Access your transaction history to see where your money is going. Look for recurring charges, subscriptions, and unexpected expenses.</li><li><strong>Categorize Your Spending</strong>: Many online banking platforms allow you to categorize your expenses.

Use your online banking information to compile a list of your assets (savings, investments) and liabilities (debts, loans) to determine your net worth.</li><li><strong>Evaluate Your Debt-to-Income Ratio</strong>: This ratio compares your monthly debt payments to your monthly income. A lower ratio indicates better financial health.
