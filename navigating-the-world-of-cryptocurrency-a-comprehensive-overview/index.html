Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which are issued and regulated by governments, cryptocurrencies operate on a peer-to-peer network, enabling secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries such as banks. The underlying technology that powers cryptocurrencies is known as blockchain, a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a network of computers.</p><h3 id=key-characteristics-of-cryptocurrency>Key Characteristics of Cryptocurrency</h3><ol><li><p><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity or government. This decentralized nature ensures greater transparency and security in transactions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>: Cryptocurrencies utilize cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. This makes them resistant to fraud and counterfeiting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anonymity</strong>: While not all cryptocurrencies offer complete anonymity, many provide a level of privacy in transactions, allowing users to maintain a certain degree of confidentiality.</p></li></ol><h2 id=types-of-cryptocurrencies>Types of Cryptocurrencies</h2><p>The cryptocurrency market is incredibly diverse, with thousands of digital currencies in existence, each with its own unique features and use cases.
