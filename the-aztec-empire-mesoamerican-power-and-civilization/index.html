At its peak, the empire was one of the most dominant and influential societies in the Americas, with a population of over 20 million people.</p><h2 id=origins>Origins</h2><p>The Aztecs were a Nahua people, who migrated to the Valley of Mexico in the 13th century. They were a nomadic tribe, and their first settlement was on the island of Tenochtitlán, which is now Mexico City. The Aztecs were a complex society, with a system of government, economy, and social hierarchy.</p><h2 id=government>Government</h2><p>The Aztec government was a theocratic monarchy, with the emperor as the supreme ruler. The emperor was believed to be the representative of the gods, and was responsible for maintaining the balance and order of the universe. The government was divided into three main branches: the executive, judicial, and legislative. The executive branch was headed by the emperor, while the judicial branch was headed by the chief judge, and the legislative branch was headed by the council of elders.</p><h2 id=economy>Economy</h2><p>The Aztec economy was based on agriculture, trade, and warfare. The empire was self-sufficient, with a system of agriculture that produced a surplus of food. The Aztecs also engaged in extensive trade with other Mesoamerican cities, exchanging goods such as cotton, cacao, and obsidian. Warfare was an important aspect of the Aztec economy, as it provided a source of slaves, goods, and territory.</p><h2 id=society>Society</h2><p>Aztec society was divided into three main castes: the nobles, the commoners, and the slaves. The nobles were the ruling class, and held positions of power and authority. The commoners were the majority of the population, and were involved in agriculture, trade, and crafts. The slaves were obtained through warfare, and were used for labor and as sacrifices.</p><h2 id=culture>Culture</h2><p>Aztec culture was a rich and vibrant tapestry of art, architecture, and literature. The Aztecs were skilled craftsmen, and produced beautiful works of art, such as ceramics, textiles, and jewelry. They also built impressive structures, such as temples, palaces, and ball courts. The Aztecs were also known for their literature, which included poetry, drama, and history.</p><h2 id=conquest>Conquest</h2><p>The Aztec Empire was conquered by the Spanish in the 16th century. The Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés arrived in Mexico in 1519, and was initially welcomed by the Aztecs as a god. However, Cortés and his men soon turned against the Aztecs, and the empire was conquered. The Aztecs resisted the Spanish conquest, but were ultimately defeated.</p><h2 id=legacy>Legacy</h2><p>The Aztec Empire left a lasting legacy in Mesoamerica. The Aztecs were a powerful and influential civilization, and their culture and achievements continue to be studied and admired today. The Aztecs also left a legacy in the Americas, as their language, architecture, and art continue to influence modern societies.</p><p>In conclusion, the Aztec Empire was a powerful and influential civilization that flourished in Mesoamerica for over a century. The empire was known for its complex government, economy, and society, and its rich culture and achievements. The Aztecs left a lasting legacy in Mesoamerica, and their culture and achievements continue to be studied and admired today.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><nav class=paginav>Category:<a href=https://various.googlexy.com/categories/history/>History</a></nav><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://various.googlexy.com/the-aztec-empire-gods-gold-and-human-sacrifices/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>The Aztec Empire: Gods, Gold, and Human Sacrifices</span>
