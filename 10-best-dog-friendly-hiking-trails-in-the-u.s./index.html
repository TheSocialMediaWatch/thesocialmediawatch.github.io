The fresh air, exercise, scenic views, and the bond you share on these ventures make each trail memorable. But not all hiking trails are created equal, especially for dogs. Rugged terrain, unwelcoming policies, or hazards like steep drops can turn a pleasant outing into a challenge. To help you plan the ultimate adventure with your furry best friend, we’ve rounded up ten of the best dog-friendly hiking trails across the United States. Each of these trails offers unique landscapes and experiences, ensuring both you and your pup have an unforgettable time.</p><hr><h2 id=1-runyon-canyon-park--los-angeles-california>1. <strong>Runyon Canyon Park – Los Angeles, California</strong></h2><p>Situated in the heart of Los Angeles, this urban oasis is perfect for dog owners looking for moderate hikes with panoramic city views.
