Cisplatin works by binding to the DNA of cancer cells and interfering with their ability to replicate, ultimately leading to the destruction of the tumor. Other metals, such as gold and ruthenium, are also being investigated for their potential to treat cancer through similar mechanisms.</p><p>Moreover, inorganic compounds like gadolinium are used as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allowing doctors to obtain detailed images of the inside of the body. These contrast agents enhance the visibility of tissues and organs, aiding in the diagnosis of conditions such as tumors, infections, and blood vessel abnormalities.</p><h3 id=antimicrobial-properties-of-metals>Antimicrobial Properties of Metals</h3><p>Inorganic chemistry also provides antimicrobial agents that help fight infections. Silver, for instance, is known for its antimicrobial properties and is commonly used in wound dressings and medical devices such as catheters and implants. Silver ions can disrupt the cell walls of bacteria, preventing them from reproducing and causing infections. This has led to silver being incorporated into various products, from medical bandages to water filtration systems, to help safeguard public health.</p><h2 id=energy-production-and-storage>Energy Production and Storage</h2><p>The demand for clean and sustainable energy has driven the development of new technologies aimed at improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental impacts.
