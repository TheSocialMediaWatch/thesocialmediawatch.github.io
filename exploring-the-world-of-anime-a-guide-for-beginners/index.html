It&rsquo;s essential to pace yourself, especially with longer series, to avoid burnout.</p><h3 id=3-embracing-different-styles>3. Embracing Different Styles</h3><p>Anime is renowned for its diverse animation styles, from the colorful and exaggerated aesthetics of shonen to the more subdued and realistic visuals of seinen.
