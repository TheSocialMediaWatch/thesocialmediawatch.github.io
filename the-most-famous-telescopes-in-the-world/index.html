With its powerful adaptive optics system, the VLT can correct for atmospheric distortions, providing sharper images than any other ground-based telescope.</p><h2 id=the-james-webb-space-telescope>The James Webb Space Telescope</h2><p>Scheduled to launch in 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is set to become the most powerful space telescope ever built. With its advanced infrared capabilities, the JWST will complement the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing scientists to study the universe in greater detail and at longer wavelengths of light. This next-generation space telescope will focus on the early universe, the formation of galaxies, and the study of exoplanets.</p><p>The James Webb Space Telescope has a primary mirror that spans 6.5 meters (21 feet) in diameter, which is over two and a half times larger than Hubble&rsquo;s mirror. JWST&rsquo;s unprecedented ability to observe distant objects will allow astronomers to peer into the early stages of the universe, just a few hundred million years after the Big Bang. By studying the formation of the first stars and galaxies, the JWST will shed light on the origins of the universe and help answer fundamental questions about our place in the cosmos.</p><h2 id=the-keck-observatory>The Keck Observatory</h2><p>Located on the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii, the Keck Observatory is home to two of the largest optical telescopes in the world. Each of its telescopes has a 10-meter (33-foot) primary mirror, and they are equipped with advanced instruments that allow astronomers to study objects in the universe with incredible precision.</p><p>The Keck Observatory has made significant contributions to our understanding of exoplanets, black holes, and the formation of galaxies. One of its most notable achievements was the discovery of a supermassive black hole in the center of a distant galaxy. The observatory has also been instrumental in the study of the atmospheres of exoplanets, helping scientists determine their composition and potential habitability. With its location at the top of Mauna Kea, one of the best astronomical observing sites on Earth, the Keck Observatory provides some of the clearest views of the night sky.</p><h2 id=the-giant-magellan-telescope>The Giant Magellan Telescope</h2><p>Currently under construction in the Atacama Desert in Chile, the Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) is set to be one of the largest optical telescopes in the world upon its completion. With a primary mirror that spans 24.5 meters (80 feet) in diameter, the GMT will have a resolution 10 times greater than that of the Hubble Space Telescope.</p><p>The GMT will enable astronomers to study the formation of stars, galaxies, and black holes with unprecedented clarity. It will also allow for the detailed study of exoplanets and the search for signs of life beyond our solar system. The telescope&rsquo;s large mirror will be composed of seven individual segments, each measuring 8.4 meters (27.5 feet) in diameter. When completed, the GMT will be one of the most powerful ground-based telescopes in existence.</p><h2 id=the-alma-observatory>The Alma Observatory</h2><p>The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is an array of 66 radio telescopes located in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
